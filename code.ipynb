            "read minus 40 degrees -- and don't bother asking\n",
            "if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit, minus 40 is where the two scales meet -- it was very cold. And as I stood on the front porch\n",
            "fumbling in my pockets, I found I didn't have my keys. In fact, I could see them\n",
            "through the window, lying on the dining room table\n",
            "where I had left them. So I quickly ran around\n",
            "and tried all the other doors and windows, and they were locked tight. I thought about calling a locksmith --\n",
            "at least I had my cellphone, but at midnight, it could take a while\n",

            "Jeff's house for the night because I had an early flight\n",
            "to Europe the next morning, and I needed to get\n",
            "my passport and my suitcase. So, desperate and freezing cold, I found a large rock and I broke\n",
            "through the basement window, cleared out the shards of glass, I crawled through, I found a piece of cardboard\n",
            "and taped it up over the opening, figuring that in the morning,\n",
            "on the way to the airport, I could call my contractor\n",
            "and ask him to fix it. This was going to be expensive, but probably no more expensive\n",
            "than a middle-of-the-night locksmith, so I figured, under the circumstances,\n",
            "I was coming out even. Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit\n",
            "about how the brain performs under stress. It releases cortisol\n",
            "that raises your heart rate, it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking. So the next morning, when I woke up on too little sleep, worrying about the hole in the window, and a mental note\n",
            "that I had to call my contractor, and the freezing temperatures, and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe, and, you know, with all\n",
            "the cortisol in my brain, my thinking was cloudy, but I didn't know it was cloudy\n",

            "raced back to the airport, I made it just in time, but they had given away\n",
            "my seat to someone else, so I got stuck in the back of the plane,\n",
            "next to the bathrooms, in a seat that wouldn't recline,\n",
            "on an eight-hour flight. Well, I had a lot of time to think\n",
            "during those eight hours and no sleep. (Laughter) And I started wondering,\n",
            "are there things that I can do, systems that I can put into place, that will prevent bad things\n",
            "from happening? Or at least if bad things happen, will minimize the likelihood\n",
            "of it being a total catastrophe. So I started thinking about that, but my thoughts didn't crystallize\n",
            "until about a month later. I was having dinner with my colleague,\n",
            "Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, and I somewhat embarrassedly told him\n",
            "about having broken my window, and, you know, forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing\n",
            "something called prospective hindsight. (Laughter) It's something that he had gotten\n",
            "from the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written about it\n",
            "a few years before, also called the pre-mortem. Now, you all know what the postmortem is. Whenever there's a disaster, a team of experts come in and they try\n",
            "to figure out what went wrong, right? Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained, you look ahead and you try to figure out\n",
            "all the things that could go wrong, and then you try to figure out\n",
            "what you can do to prevent those things from happening,\n",
            "or to minimize the damage. So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do\n",
            "in the form of a pre-mortem. Some of them are obvious,\n",
            "some of them are not so obvious. I'll start with the obvious ones. Around the home, designate a place\n",
            "for things that are easily lost. Now, this sounds\n",
            "like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science\n",
            "to back this up, based on the way our spatial memory works. There's a structure in the brain\n",
            "called the hippocampus, that evolved over tens\n",
            "of thousands of years, to keep track of the locations\n",
            "of important things -- where the well is,\n",
            "where fish can be found, that stand of fruit trees, where the friendly and enemy tribes live. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers\n",
            "becomes enlarged. It's the part of the brain\n",
            "that allows squirrels to find their nuts. And if you're wondering,\n",
            "somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off\n",
            "the olfactory sense of the squirrels, and they could still find their nuts. They weren't using smell,\n",
            "they were using the hippocampus, this exquisitely evolved mechanism\n",
            "in the brain for finding things. But it's really good for things\n",
            "that don't move around much, not so good for things that move around. So this is why we lose car keys\n",
            "and reading glasses and passports. So in the home,\n",
            "designate a spot for your keys -- a hook by the door,\n",
            "maybe a decorative bowl. For your passport, a particular drawer. For your reading glasses,\n",
            "a particular table. If you designate a spot\n",
            "and you're scrupulous about it, your things will always be there\n",
            "when you look for them. What about travel? Take a cell phone picture\n",
            "of your credit cards, your driver's license, your passport, mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud. If these things are lost or stolen,\n",
            "you can facilitate replacement. Now these are some rather obvious things. Remember, when you're under stress,\n",
            "the brain releases cortisol. Cortisol is toxic,\n",
            "and it causes cloudy thinking. So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress\n",
            "you're not going to be at your best, and you should put systems in place. And there's perhaps\n",
            "no more stressful a situation than when you're confronted\n",
            "with a medical decision to make. And at some point, all of us\n",
            "are going to be in that position, where we have to make\n",
            "a very important decision about the future of our medical care\n",
            "or that of a loved one, to help them with a decision. And so I want to talk about that. And I'm going to talk about\n",
            "a very particular medical condition. But this stands as a proxy for all kinds\n",
            "of medical decision-making, and indeed for financial decision-making,\n",
            "and social decision-making -- any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational\n",
            "assessment of the facts. So suppose you go to your doctor\n",
            "and the doctor says, \"I just got your lab work back,\n",
            "your cholesterol's a little high.\" Now, you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk\n",
            "of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke. And so you're thinking having high cholesterol\n",
            "isn't the best thing, and so the doctor says,\n",
            "\"You know, I'd like to give you a drug that will help you\n",
            "lower your cholesterol, a statin.\" And you've probably heard of statins, you know that they're among\n",
            "the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today, you probably even know\n",
            "people who take them. And so you're thinking,\n",
            "\"Yeah! Give me the statin.\" But there's a question\n",
            "you should ask at this point, a statistic you should ask for that most doctors\n",
            "don't like talking about, and pharmaceutical companies\n",
            "like talking about even less. It's for the number needed to treat. Now, what is this, the NNT? It's the number of people\n",
            "that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery\n",
            "or any medical procedure before one person is helped. And you're thinking,\n",
            "what kind of crazy statistic is that? The number should be one. My doctor wouldn't prescribe\n",
            "something to me if it's not going to help. But actually, medical practice\n",
            "doesn't work that way. And it's not the doctor's fault, if it's anybody's fault,\n",
            "it's the fault of scientists like me. We haven't figured out\n",
            "the underlying mechanisms well enough. But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work\n",
            "in only 30 to 50 percent of the people. So the number needed to treat\n",
            "for the most widely prescribed statin, what do you suppose it is? How many people have to take it\n",
            "before one person is helped? 300. This is according to research by research practitioners\n",
            "Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband, independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com. I ran through the numbers myself. 300 people have to\n",
            "take the drug for a year before one heart attack, stroke\n",
            "or other adverse event is prevented. Now you're probably thinking, \"Well, OK, one in 300 chance\n",
            "of lowering my cholesterol. Why not, doc? Give me\n",
            "the prescription anyway.\" But you should ask at this point\n",
            "for another statistic, and that is, \"Tell me\n",
            "about the side effects.\" Right? So for this particular drug, the side effects occur\n",
            "in five percent of the patients. And they include terrible things -- debilitating muscle and joint pain,\n",
            "gastrointestinal distress -- but now you're thinking, \"Five percent, not very likely\n",
            "it's going to happen to me, I'll still take the drug.\" But wait a minute. Remember under stress\n",
            "you're not thinking clearly. So think about how you're going\n",
            "to work through this ahead of time, so you don't have to manufacture\n",
            "the chain of reasoning on the spot. 300 people take the drug, right?\n",
            "One person's helped, five percent of those 300\n",
            "have side effects, that's 15 people. You're 15 times more likely\n",
            "to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug. Now, I'm not saying whether you\n",
            "should take the statin or not. I'm just saying you should have\n",
            "this conversation with your doctor. Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the principle\n",
            "of informed consent. You have the right to have access\n",
            "to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether\n",
            "you want to take the risks or not. Now you might be thinking I've pulled this number\n",
            "out of the air for shock value, but in fact it's rather typical,\n",
            "this number needed to treat. For the most widely performed surgery\n",
            "on men over the age of 50, removal of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is 49. That's right, 49 surgeries are done\n",
            "for every one person who's helped. And the side effects in that case\n",
            "occur in 50 percent of the patients. They include impotence,\n",
            "erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence. And if you're lucky, and you're one\n",
            "of the 50 percent who has these, they'll only last for a year or two. So the idea of the pre-mortem\n",
            "is to think ahead of time to the questions\n",
            "that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward. You don't want to have to manufacture\n",
            "all of this on the spot. And you also want to think\n",
            "about things like quality of life. Because you have a choice oftentimes, do you I want a shorter life\n",
            "that's pain-free, or a longer life that might have\n",
            "a great deal of pain towards the end? These are things to talk about\n",
            "and think about now, with your family and your loved ones. You might change your mind\n",
            "in the heat of the moment, but at least you're practiced\n",
            "with this kind of thinking. Remember, our brain under stress\n",
            "releases cortisol, and one of the things\n",
            "that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down. There's an evolutionary reason for this. Face-to-face with a predator,\n",
            "you don't need your digestive system, or your libido, or your immune system, because if you're body is expending\n",
            "metabolism on those things and you don't react quickly, you might become the lion's lunch,\n",
            "and then none of those things matter. Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out the window\n",
            "during those times of stress is rational, logical thinking, as Danny Kahneman\n",

            "of power and dominance? Well, this is what they are. So in the animal kingdom,\n",
            "they are about expanding. So you make yourself big, you stretch out, you take up space,\n",
            "you're basically opening up. It's about opening up. And this is true\n",
            "across the animal kingdom. It's not just limited to primates. And humans do the same thing. (Laughter) So they do this both when they have\n",

            "powerful in the moment. And this one is especially interesting\n",

            "do when it comes to power is that we complement\n",
            "the other's nonverbals. So if someone is being\n",
            "really powerful with us, we tend to make ourselves smaller.\n",
            "We don't mirror them. We do the opposite of them. So I'm watching this behavior\n",
            "in the classroom, and what do I notice? I notice that MBA students really exhibit\n",
            "the full range of power nonverbals. So you have people\n",
            "who are like caricatures of alphas, really coming into the room, they get\n",
            "right into the middle of the room before class even starts,\n",

            "and they make themselves tiny, and they go like this\n",
            "when they raise their hand. I notice a couple of things about this. One, you're not going to be surprised. It seems to be related to gender. So women are much more likely\n",
            "to do this kind of thing than men. Women feel chronically\n",
            "less powerful than men, so this is not surprising. But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed\n",
            "to be related to the extent to which the students were participating,\n",
            "and how well they were participating. And this is really important\n",
            "in the MBA classroom, because participation\n",
            "counts for half the grade. So business schools have been struggling\n",
            "with this gender grade gap. You get these equally qualified\n",
            "women and men coming in and then you get\n",
            "these differences in grades, and it seems to be partly\n",
            "attributable to participation. So I started to wonder, you know, okay, so you have these people coming in\n",
            "like this, and they're participating. Is it possible that we could\n",
            "get people to fake it and would it lead them\n",
            "to participate more? So my main collaborator\n",
            "Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley, and I really wanted to know,\n",
            "can you fake it till you make it? Like, can you do this\n",
            "just for a little while and actually experience\n",
            "a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful? So we know that our nonverbals\n",
            "govern how other people think and feel about us.\n",
            "There's a lot of evidence. But our question really was, do our nonverbals govern\n",
            "how we think and feel about ourselves? There's some evidence that they do. So, for example, we smile\n",
            "when we feel happy, but also, when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth\n",
            "like this, it makes us feel happy. So it goes both ways. When it comes to power,\n",
            "it also goes both ways. So when you feel powerful, you're more likely to do this, but it's also possible\n",
            "that when you pretend to be powerful, you are more likely\n",
            "to actually feel powerful. So the second question\n",
            "really was, you know, so we know that our minds\n",
            "change our bodies, but is it also true\n",
            "that our bodies change our minds? And when I say minds,\n",
            "in the case of the powerful, what am I talking about? So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things\n",
            "that make up our thoughts and feelings, and in my case, that's hormones.\n",
            "I look at hormones. So what do the minds of the powerful\n",
            "versus the powerless look like? So powerful people tend to be,\n",
            "not surprisingly, more assertive and more confident,\n",
            "more optimistic. They actually feel they're going to win\n",
            "even at games of chance. They also tend to be able\n",
            "to think more abstractly. So there are a lot of differences.\n",
            "They take more risks. There are a lot of differences\n",
            "between powerful and powerless people. Physiologically,\n",
            "there also are differences on two key hormones: testosterone,\n",
            "which is the dominance hormone, and cortisol, which is the stress hormone. So what we find is that high-power\n",
            "alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol, and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone\n",
            "and low cortisol. So what does that mean?\n",
            "When you think about power, people tended to think\n",
            "only about testosterone, because that was about dominance. But really, power is also about\n",
            "how you react to stress. So do you want the high-power\n",
            "leader that's dominant, high on testosterone,\n",
            "but really stress reactive? Probably not, right? You want the person who's powerful\n",
            "and assertive and dominant, but not very stress reactive,\n",
            "the person who's laid back. So we know that in primate hierarchies, if an alpha needs to take over, if an individual needs to take over\n",
            "an alpha role sort of suddenly, within a few days,\n",
            "that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol\n",
            "has dropped significantly. So we have this evidence,\n",
            "both that the body can shape the mind, at least at the facial level, and also that role changes\n",
            "can shape the mind. So what happens, okay,\n",
            "you take a role change, what happens if you do that\n",
            "at a really minimal level, like this tiny manipulation,\n",
            "this tiny intervention? \"For two minutes,\" you say,\n",
            "\"I want you to stand like this, and it's going to make you feel\n",
            "more powerful.\" So this is what we did. We decided to bring people into the lab\n",
            "and run a little experiment, and these people adopted, for two minutes, either high-power poses\n",
            "or low-power poses, and I'm just going to show\n",
            "you five of the poses, although they took on only two. So here's one. A couple more. This one has been dubbed\n",
            "the \"Wonder Woman\" by the media. Here are a couple more. So you can be standing\n",
            "or you can be sitting. And here are the low-power poses. So you're folding up,\n",
            "you're making yourself small. This one is very low-power. When you're touching your neck,\n",
            "you're really protecting yourself. So this is what happens. They come in, they spit into a vial, for two minutes, we say,\n",
            "\"You need to do this or this.\" They don't look at pictures of the poses. We don't want to prime them\n",
            "with a concept of power. We want them to be feeling power. So two minutes they do this. We then ask them, \"How powerful\n",
            "do you feel?\" on a series of items, and then we give them\n",
            "an opportunity to gamble, and then we take another saliva sample. That's it. That's the whole experiment. So this is what we find. Risk tolerance, which is the gambling, we find that when you are\n",
            "in the high-power pose condition, 86 percent of you will gamble. When you're in the low-power\n",
            "pose condition, only 60 percent, and that's\n",
            "a whopping significant difference. Here's what we find on testosterone. From their baseline when they come in, high-power people experience\n",
            "about a 20-percent increase, and low-power people experience\n",
            "about a 10-percent decrease. So again, two minutes,\n",
            "and you get these changes. Here's what you get on cortisol. High-power people experience\n",
            "about a 25-percent decrease, and the low-power people experience\n",
            "about a 15-percent increase. So two minutes lead\n",
            "to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive,\n",
            "confident and comfortable, or really stress-reactive,\n",
            "and feeling sort of shut down. And we've all had the feeling, right? So it seems that our nonverbals do govern\n",
            "how we think and feel about ourselves, so it's not just others,\n",
            "but it's also ourselves. Also, our bodies change our minds. But the next question, of course, is, can power posing for a few minutes really change your life\n",
            "in meaningful ways? This is in the lab, it's this little task,\n",
            "it's just a couple of minutes. Where can you actually apply this? Which we cared about, of course. And so we think where you want to use this\n",
            "is evaluative situations, like social threat situations. Where are you being evaluated,\n",
            "either by your friends? For teenagers,\n",
            "it's at the lunchroom table. For some people it's speaking\n",
            "at a school board meeting. It might be giving a pitch\n",
            "or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview. We decided that the one\n",
            "that most people could relate to because most people had been through,\n",
            "was the job interview. So we published these findings, and the media are all over it, and they say, Okay, so this is what you do when you go in\n",
            "for the job interview, right? (Laughter) You know, so we were of course\n",
            "horrified, and said, Oh my God, no,\n",
            "that's not what we meant at all. For numerous reasons, no, don't do that. Again, this is not about you\n",
            "talking to other people. It's you talking to yourself. What do you do before you go\n",
            "into a job interview? You do this. You're sitting down.\n",
            "You're looking at your iPhone -- or your Android, not trying\n",
            "to leave anyone out. You're looking at your notes, you're hunching up, making yourself small, when really what you should\n",
            "be doing maybe is this, like, in the bathroom, right?\n",
            "Do that. Find two minutes. So that's what we want to test. Okay? So we bring people into a lab, and they do either high-\n",
            "or low-power poses again, they go through\n",
            "a very stressful job interview. It's five minutes long.\n",
            "They are being recorded. They're being judged also, and the judges are trained\n",
            "to give no nonverbal feedback, so they look like this. Imagine this is the person\n",
            "interviewing you. So for five minutes, nothing,\n",
            "and this is worse than being heckled. People hate this. It's what Marianne LaFrance calls\n",
            "\"standing in social quicksand.\" So this really spikes your cortisol. So this is the job interview\n",
            "we put them through, because we really wanted\n",
            "to see what happened. We then have these coders look\n",
            "at these tapes, four of them. They're blind to the hypothesis.\n",
            "They're blind to the conditions. They have no idea\n",
            "who's been posing in what pose, and they end up looking\n",
            "at these sets of tapes, and they say,\n",
            "\"We want to hire these people,\" all the high-power posers. \"We don't want to hire these people. We also evaluate these people\n",
            "much more positively overall.\" But what's driving it? It's not about the content of the speech. It's about the presence\n",
            "that they're bringing to the speech. Because we rate them\n",
            "on all these variables related to competence,\n",
            "like, how well-structured is the speech? How good is it?\n",
            "What are their qualifications? No effect on those things.\n",
            "This is what's affected. These kinds of things. People are bringing\n",
            "their true selves, basically. They're bringing themselves. They bring their ideas, but as themselves, with no, you know, residue over them. So this is what's driving the effect,\n",
            "or mediating the effect. So when I tell people about this, that our bodies change our minds\n",
            "and our minds can change our behavior, and our behavior can change\n",
            "our outcomes, they say to me, \"It feels fake.\" Right? So I said, fake it till you make it. It's not me. I don't want to get there\n",
            "and then still feel like a fraud. I don't want to feel like an impostor. I don't want to get there only to feel\n",
            "like I'm not supposed to be here. And that really resonated with me, because I want to tell you\n",
            "a little story about being an impostor and feeling like\n",
            "I'm not supposed to be here. When I was 19, I was\n",
            "in a really bad car accident. I was thrown out of a car,\n",
            "rolled several times. I was thrown from the car. And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward, and I had been withdrawn from college, and I learned that my IQ had dropped\n",
            "by two standard deviations, which was very traumatic. I knew my IQ because\n",
            "I had identified with being smart, and I had been called gifted as a child. So I'm taken out of college,\n",
            "I keep trying to go back. They say, \"You're not going\n",
            "to finish college. Just, you know, there are other\n",
            "things for you to do, but that's not going to work out for you.\" So I really struggled\n",
            "with this, and I have to say, having your identity taken\n",
            "from you, your core identity, and for me it was being smart, having that taken from you, there's nothing that leaves you feeling\n",
            "more powerless than that. So I felt entirely powerless. I worked and worked, and I got lucky, and worked, and got lucky, and worked. Eventually I graduated from college. It took me four years\n",
            "longer than my peers, and I convinced someone,\n",
            "my angel advisor, Susan Fiske, to take me on,\n",
            "and so I ended up at Princeton, and I was like,\n",
            "I am not supposed to be here. I am an impostor. And the night before my first-year talk, and the first-year talk at Princeton\n",
            "is a 20-minute talk to 20 people. That's it. I was so afraid of being\n",
            "found out the next day that I called her\n",
            "and said, \"I'm quitting.\" She was like, \"You are not quitting, because I took a gamble\n",
            "on you, and you're staying. You're going to stay, and this is\n",
            "what you're going to do. You are going to fake it. You're going to do every talk\n",
            "that you ever get asked to do. You're just going to do it\n",
            "and do it and do it, even if you're terrified\n",
            "and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience, until you have this moment where you say,\n",
            "'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it. Like, I have become this.\n",
            "I am actually doing this.'\" So that's what I did. Five years in grad school, a few years, you know,\n",
            "I'm at Northwestern, I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard, I'm not really thinking about it anymore,\n",
            "but for a long time I had been thinking, \"Not supposed to be here.\" So at the end of my first year at Harvard, a student who had not talked\n",
            "in class the entire semester, who I had said, \"Look, you've gotta\n",
            "participate or else you're going to fail,\" came into my office.\n",

When we think about how people work, the naive intuition we have is that people are like rats in a maze -- that all people care about is money, and the moment we give them money, we can direct them to work one way, we can direct them to work another way.

            "even for less money, because after all,\n",
            "they get more internal joy from it. And the people who love Legos less\n",
            "would build less Legos because the enjoyment\n",
            "that they derive from it is lower. And that's actually what we found\n",
            "in the meaningful condition. There was a very nice correlation\n",

            "some of these Lego experiments, and they said they felt like they had\n",
            "just been through that experiment. And I asked them, I said, \"How many of you now show up\n",
            "to work later than you used to?\" And everybody raised their hand. I said, \"How many of you now go home\n",
            "earlier than you used to?\" Everybody raised their hand. I asked them, \"How many of you now add not-so-kosher things\n",
            "to your expense reports?\" And they didn't raise their hands, but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do\n",
            "with expense reports. And then I asked them, I said, \"What could the CEO have done\n",
            "to make you not as depressed?\" And they came up with all kinds of ideas. They said the CEO could have asked\n",
            "them to present to the whole company about their journey\n",
            "over the last two years and what they decided to do. He could have asked them to think\n",

            "of the organization. He could have asked them to build\n",
            "some next-generation prototypes, and see how they would work. But the thing is that any one of those\n",
            "would require some effort and motivation. And I think the CEO basically did not\n",
            "understand the importance of meaning. If the CEO, just like our participants, thought the essence\n",
            "of meaning is unimportant, then he [wouldn't] care. And he would say, \"At the moment\n",
            "I directed you in this way, and now that I'm directing\n",
            "you in this way, everything will be okay.\" But if you understood\n",
            "how important meaning is, then you would figure out\n",
            "that it's actually important to spend some time, energy and effort in getting people to care more\n",
            "about what they're doing. The next experiment\n",
            "was slightly different. We took a sheet of paper\n",
            "with random letters, and we asked people\n",
            "to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other. That was the task. People did the first sheet, then we asked if they wanted to do\n",
            "another for a little less money, the next sheet for a little bit\n",
            "less, and so on and so forth. And we had three conditions. In the first condition, people\n",
            "wrote their name on the sheet, found all the pairs of letters, gave it to the experimenter, the experimenter would look at it, scan it from top to bottom, say \"Uh huh,\" and put it\n",
            "on the pile next to them. In the second condition,\n",
            "people did not write their name on it. The experimenter looked at it, took the sheet of paper,\n",
            "did not look at it, did not scan it, and simply put it on the pile of pages. So you take a piece,\n",
            "you just put it on the side. In the third condition, the experimenter got the sheet of paper, and put it directly into a shredder. (Laughter) What happened in those three conditions? In this plot I'm showing you\n",
            "at what pay rate people stopped. So low numbers mean\n",
            "that people worked harder. They worked for much longer. In the acknowledged condition, people worked all the way\n",
            "down to 15 cents. At 15 cents per page, they basically stopped these efforts. In the shredder condition, it was twice\n",
            "as much -- 30 cents per sheet. And this is basically\n",
            "the result we had before. You shred people's efforts, output -- you get them not to be as happy\n",
            "with what they're doing. But I should point out, by the way, that in the shredder condition,\n",
            "people could have cheated. They could have done not so good work, because they realized\n",
            "people were just shredding it. So maybe the first sheet\n",
            "you'd do good work, but then you see nobody\n",
            "is really testing it, so you would do more and more and more. So in fact, in the shredder condition, people could have submitted more work\n",
            "and gotten more money, and put less effort into it. But what about the ignored condition? Would the ignored condition\n",
            "be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder,\n",
            "or somewhere in the middle? It turns out it was\n",
            "almost like the shredder. Now there's good news and bad news here. The bad news is that ignoring\n",
            "the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding\n",
            "their effort in front of their eyes. Ignoring gets you a whole way out there. The good news is that by simply looking\n",
            "at something that somebody has done, scanning it and saying \"Uh huh,\" that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve\n",
            "people's motivations. So the good news is that adding motivation doesn't seem to be so difficult. The bad news is\n",
            "that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy, and if we don't think about it\n",
            "carefully, we might overdo it. So this is all in terms\n",
            "of negative motivation, or eliminating negative motivation. The next part I want to show you\n",
            "is something about positive motivation. So there is a store\n",
            "in the U.S. called IKEA. And IKEA is a store\n",
            "with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble. (Laughter) I don't know about you, but every time I assemble one of those, it takes me much longer,\n",
            "it's much more effortful, it's much more confusing,\n",
            "I put things in the wrong way -- I can't say I enjoy those pieces. I can't say I enjoy the process. But when I finish it, I seem to like those\n",
            "IKEA pieces of furniture more than I like other ones. (Laughter) And there's an old story about cake mixes. So when they started\n",
            "cake mixes in the '40s, they would take this powder\n",
            "and they would put it in a box, and they would ask housewives\n",
            "to basically pour it in, stir some water in it, mix it, put it in the oven,\n",
            "and -- voila -- you had cake. But it turns out they were very unpopular. People did not want them, and they thought about\n",
            "all kinds of reasons for that. Maybe the taste was not good? No, the taste was great. What they figured out was\n",
            "that there was not enough effort involved. It was so easy that nobody\n",
            "could serve cake to their guests and say, \"Here is my cake.\" No, it was somebody else's cake,\n",
            "as if you bought it in the store. It didn't really feel like your own. So what did they do? They took the eggs and the milk\n",
            "out of the powder. (Laughter) Now you had to break\n",
            "the eggs and add them, you had to measure the milk\n",
            "and add it, mixing it. Now it was your cake.\n",
            "Now everything was fine. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, I think a little bit\n",
            "like the IKEA effect, by getting people to work harder, they actually got them to love\n",
            "what they're doing to a higher degree. So how do we look at this\n",
            "question experimentally? We asked people to build some origami. We gave them instructions\n",
            "on how to create origami, and we gave them a sheet of paper. And these were all novices, and they built something\n",
            "that was really quite ugly -- nothing like a frog or a crane. But then we told them,\n",
            "\"Look, this origami really belongs to us. You worked for us, but I'll tell\n",
            "you what, we'll sell it to you. How much do you want to pay for it?\" And we measured how much\n",
            "they were willing to pay for it. And we had two types of people: We had the people who built it, and the people who did not build it, and just looked at it\n",
            "as external observers. And what we found\n",
            "was that the builders thought that these were beautiful\n",
            "pieces of origami -- (Laughter) and they were willing to pay\n",
            "five times more for them than the people who just\n",
            "evaluated them externally. Now you could say --\n",
            "if you were a builder, do you think [you'd say],\n",
            "\"Oh, I love this origami, but I know that nobody\n",
            "else would love it?\" Or \"I love this origami,\n",
            "and everybody else will love it as well?\" Which one of those two is correct? Turns out the builders\n",
            "not only loved the origami more, they thought that everybody\n",
            "would see the world in their view. They thought everybody else\n",
            "would love it more as well. In the next version,\n",

            " years ago, broke house. driven home, around midnight dead Montreal winter, visiting friend, Jeff, across town, thermometer front porch read minus 40 degrees -- bother asking that's Celsius Fahrenheit, minus 40 two scales meet -- cold. stood front porch fumbling pockets, found keys. fact, could see window, lying dining room table left them. quickly ran around tried doors windows, locked tight. thought calling locksmith -- least cellphone, midnight, could take locksmith show up, cold. go back friend Jeff's house night early flight Europe next morning, needed get passport suitcase. So, desperate freezing cold, found large rock broke basement window, cleared shards glass, crawled through, found piece cardboard taped opening, figuring morning, way airport, could call contractor ask fix it. going expensive, probably expensive middle-of-the-night locksmith, figured, circumstances, coming even. Now, I'm neuroscientist training know little bit brain performs stress. releases cortisol raises heart rate, modulates adrenaline levels clouds thinking. next morning, woke little sleep, worrying hole window, mental note call contractor, freezing temperatures, meetings upcoming Europe, and, know, cortisol brain, thinking cloudy, know cloudy thinking cloudy. (Laughter) got airport check-in counter, realized passport. (Laughter) raced home snow ice, 40 minutes, got passport, raced back airport, made time, given away seat someone else, got stuck back plane, next bathrooms, seat recline, eight-hour flight. Well, lot time think eight hours sleep. (Laughter) started wondering, things do, systems put place, prevent bad things happening? least bad things happen, minimize likelihood total catastrophe. started thinking that, thoughts crystallize month later. dinner colleague, Danny Kahneman, Nobel Prize winner, somewhat embarrassedly told broken window, and, know, forgotten passport, Danny shared he'd practicing something called prospective hindsight. (Laughter) something gotten psychologist Gary Klein, written years before, also called pre-mortem. Now, know postmortem is. Whenever there's disaster, team experts come try figure went wrong, right? Well, pre-mortem, Danny explained, look ahead try figure things could go wrong, try figure prevent things happening, minimize damage. want talk today things form pre-mortem. obvious, obvious. I'll start obvious ones. Around home, designate place things easily lost. Now, sounds like common sense, is, there's lot science back up, based way spatial memory works. There's structure brain called hippocampus, evolved tens thousands years, keep track locations important things -- well is, fish found, stand fruit trees, friendly enemy tribes live. hippocampus part brain London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged. part brain allows squirrels find nuts. wondering, somebody actually experiment cut olfactory sense squirrels, could still find nuts. using smell, using hippocampus, exquisitely evolved mechanism brain finding things. really good things move around much, good things move around. lose car keys reading glasses passports. home, designate spot keys -- hook door, maybe decorative bowl. passport, particular drawer. reading glasses, particular table. designate spot scrupulous it, things always look them. travel? Take cell phone picture credit cards, driver's license, passport, mail cloud. things lost stolen, facilitate replacement. rather obvious things. Remember, stress, brain releases cortisol. Cortisol toxic, causes cloudy thinking. part practice pre-mortem recognize stress going best, put systems place. there's perhaps stressful situation confronted medical decision make. point, us going position, make important decision future medical care loved one, help decision. want talk that. I'm going talk particular medical condition. stands proxy kinds medical decision-making, indeed financial decision-making, social decision-making -- kind decision make would benefit rational assessment facts. suppose go doctor doctor says, \"I got lab work back, cholesterol's little high.\" Now, know high cholesterol associated increased risk cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke. thinking high cholesterol best thing, doctor says, \"You know, I'd like give drug help lower cholesterol, statin.\" probably heard statins, know they're among widely prescribed drugs world today, probably even know people take them. thinking, \"Yeah! Give statin.\" there's question ask point, statistic ask doctors like talking about, pharmaceutical companies like talking even less. number needed treat. Now, this, NNT? number people need take drug undergo surgery medical procedure one person helped. thinking, kind crazy statistic that? number one. doctor prescribe something going help. actually, medical practice work way. doctor's fault, anybody's fault, fault scientists like me. figured underlying mechanisms well enough. GlaxoSmithKline estimates 90 percent drugs work 30 50 percent people. number needed treat widely prescribed statin, suppose is? many people take one person helped? 300. according research research practitioners Jerome Groopman Pamela Hartzband, independently confirmed Bloomberg.com. ran numbers myself. 300 people take drug year one heart attack, stroke adverse event prevented. probably thinking, \"Well, OK, one 300 chance lowering cholesterol. not, doc? Give prescription anyway.\" ask point another statistic, is, \"Tell side effects.\" Right? particular drug, side effects occur five percent patients. include terrible things -- debilitating muscle joint pain, gastrointestinal distress -- thinking, \"Five percent, likely going happen me, I'll still take drug.\" wait minute. Remember stress thinking clearly. think going work ahead time, manufacture chain reasoning spot. 300 people take drug, right? One person's helped, five percent 300 side effects, that's 15 people. 15 times likely harmed drug helped drug. Now, I'm saying whether take statin not. I'm saying conversation doctor. Medical ethics requires it, part principle informed consent. right access kind information begin conversation whether want take risks not. might thinking I've pulled number air shock value, fact rather typical, number needed treat. widely performed surgery men age 50, removal prostate cancer, number needed treat 49. That's right, 49 surgeries done every one person who's helped. side effects case occur 50 percent patients. include impotence, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence. lucky, one 50 percent these, they'll last year two. idea pre-mortem think ahead time questions might able ask push conversation forward. want manufacture spot. also want think things like quality life. choice oftentimes, want shorter life that's pain-free, longer life might great deal pain towards end? things talk think now, family loved ones. might change mind heat moment, least practiced kind thinking. Remember, brain stress releases cortisol, one things happens moment whole bunch systems shut down. There's evolutionary reason this. Face-to-face predator, need digestive system, libido, immune system, body expending metabolism things react quickly, might become lion's lunch, none things matter. Unfortunately, one things goes window times stress rational, logical thinking, Danny Kahneman colleagues shown. need train think ahead kinds situations. think important point recognizing us flawed. going fail then. idea think ahead failures might be, put systems place help minimize damage, prevent bad things happening first place. Getting back snowy night Montreal, got back trip, contractor install combination lock next door, key front door it, easy remember combination. admit, still piles mail sorted, piles emails gone through. I'm completely organized, see organization gradual process, I'm getting there. Thank much. (Applause)\n",

            " Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast want start offering free no-tech life hack, requires this: change posture two minutes. give away, want ask right little audit body body. many sort making smaller? Maybe hunching, crossing legs, maybe wrapping ankles. Sometimes hold onto arms like this. Sometimes spread out. (Laughter) see you. want pay attention right now. We're going come back minutes, I'm hoping learn tweak little bit, could significantly change way life unfolds. So, we're really fascinated body language, we're particularly interested people's body language. know, we're interested in, like, know — (Laughter) — awkward interaction, smile, contemptuous glance, maybe awkward wink, maybe even something like handshake. Narrator: arriving Number 10. lucky policeman gets shake hands President United States. comes Prime Minister -- No. (Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter) (Applause) Amy Cuddy: handshake, lack handshake, us talking weeks weeks weeks. Even BBC New York Times. obviously think nonverbal behavior, body language -- call nonverbals social scientists -- language, think communication. think communication, think interactions. body language communicating me? What's mine communicating you? there's lot reason believe valid way look this. social scientists spent lot time looking effects body language, people's body language, judgments. make sweeping judgments inferences body language. judgments predict really meaningful life outcomes like hire promote, ask date. example, Nalini Ambady, researcher Tufts University, shows people watch 30-second soundless clips real physician-patient interactions, judgments physician's niceness predict whether physician sued. much whether physician incompetent, like person interacted? Even dramatic, Alex Todorov Princeton shown us judgments political candidates' faces one second predict 70 percent U.S. Senate gubernatorial race outcomes, even, let's go digital, emoticons used well online negotiations lead claim value negotiation. use poorly, bad idea. Right? think nonverbals, think judge others, judge us outcomes are. tend forget, though, audience that's influenced nonverbals, that's ourselves. also influenced nonverbals, thoughts feelings physiology. nonverbals talking about? I'm social psychologist. study prejudice, teach competitive business school, inevitable would become interested power dynamics. became especially interested nonverbal expressions power dominance. nonverbal expressions power dominance? Well, are. animal kingdom, expanding. make big, stretch out, take space, basically opening up. opening up. true across animal kingdom. limited primates. humans thing. (Laughter) power sort chronically, also they're feeling powerful moment. one especially interesting really shows us universal old expressions power are. expression, known pride, Jessica Tracy studied. shows people born sight people congenitally blind win physical competition. cross finish line they've won, matter they've never seen anyone it. this. arms V, chin slightly lifted. feel powerless? exactly opposite. close up. wrap up. make small. want bump person next us. again, animals humans thing. happens put together high low power. tend comes power complement other's nonverbals. someone really powerful us, tend make smaller. mirror them. opposite them. I'm watching behavior classroom, notice? notice MBA students really exhibit full range power nonverbals. people like caricatures alphas, really coming room, get right middle room class even starts, like really want occupy space. sit down, they're sort spread out. raise hands like this. people virtually collapsing come in. soon come in, see it. see faces bodies, sit chair make tiny, go like raise hand. notice couple things this. One, going surprised. seems related gender. women much likely kind thing men. Women feel chronically less powerful men, surprising. thing noticed also seemed related extent students participating, well participating. really important MBA classroom, participation counts half grade. business schools struggling gender grade gap. get equally qualified women men coming get differences grades, seems partly attributable participation. started wonder, know, okay, people coming like this, they're participating. possible could get people fake would lead participate more? main collaborator Dana Carney, who's Berkeley, really wanted know, fake till make it? Like, little actually experience behavioral outcome makes seem powerful? know nonverbals govern people think feel us. There's lot evidence. question really was, nonverbals govern think feel ourselves? There's evidence do. So, example, smile feel happy, also, we're forced smile holding pen teeth like this, makes us feel happy. goes ways. comes power, also goes ways. feel powerful, likely this, also possible pretend powerful, likely actually feel powerful. second question really was, know, know minds change bodies, also true bodies change minds? say minds, case powerful, talking about? I'm talking thoughts feelings sort physiological things make thoughts feelings, case, that's hormones. look hormones. minds powerful versus powerless look like? powerful people tend be, surprisingly, assertive confident, optimistic. actually feel they're going win even games chance. also tend able think abstractly. lot differences. take risks. lot differences powerful powerless people. Physiologically, also differences two key hormones: testosterone, dominance hormone, cortisol, stress hormone. find high-power alpha males primate hierarchies high testosterone low cortisol, powerful effective leaders also high testosterone low cortisol. mean? think power, people tended think testosterone, dominance. really, power also react stress. want high-power leader that's dominant, high testosterone, really stress reactive? Probably not, right? want person who's powerful assertive dominant, stress reactive, person who's laid back. know primate hierarchies, alpha needs take over, individual needs take alpha role sort suddenly, within days, individual's testosterone gone significantly cortisol dropped significantly. evidence, body shape mind, least facial level, also role changes shape mind. happens, okay, take role change, happens really minimal level, like tiny manipulation, tiny intervention? \"For two minutes,\" say, \"I want stand like this, going make feel powerful.\" did. decided bring people lab run little experiment, people adopted, two minutes, either high-power poses low-power poses, I'm going show five poses, although took two. here's one. couple more. one dubbed \"Wonder Woman\" media. couple more. standing sitting. low-power poses. folding up, making small. one low-power. touching neck, really protecting yourself. happens. come in, spit vial, two minutes, say, \"You need this.\" look pictures poses. want prime concept power. want feeling power. two minutes this. ask them, \"How powerful feel?\" series items, give opportunity gamble, take another saliva sample. That's it. That's whole experiment. find. Risk tolerance, gambling, find high-power pose condition, 86 percent gamble. low-power pose condition, 60 percent, that's whopping significant difference. Here's find testosterone. baseline come in, high-power people experience 20-percent increase, low-power people experience 10-percent decrease. again, two minutes, get changes. Here's get cortisol. High-power people experience 25-percent decrease, low-power people experience 15-percent increase. two minutes lead hormonal changes configure brain basically either assertive, confident comfortable, really stress-reactive, feeling sort shut down. we've feeling, right? seems nonverbals govern think feel ourselves, others, also ourselves. Also, bodies change minds. next question, course, is, power posing minutes really change life meaningful ways? lab, little task, couple minutes. actually apply this? cared about, course. think want use evaluative situations, like social threat situations. evaluated, either friends? teenagers, lunchroom table. people speaking school board meeting. might giving pitch giving talk like job interview. decided one people could relate people through, job interview. published findings, media it, say, Okay, go job interview, right? (Laughter) know, course horrified, said, Oh God, no, that's meant all. numerous reasons, no, that. Again, talking people. talking yourself. go job interview? this. sitting down. looking iPhone -- Android, trying leave anyone out. looking notes, hunching up, making small, really maybe this, like, bathroom, right? that. Find two minutes. that's want test. Okay? bring people lab, either high- low-power poses again, go stressful job interview. five minutes long. recorded. They're judged also, judges trained give nonverbal feedback, look like this. Imagine person interviewing you. five minutes, nothing, worse heckled. People hate this. Marianne LaFrance calls \"standing social quicksand.\" really spikes cortisol. job interview put through, really wanted see happened. coders look tapes, four them. They're blind hypothesis. They're blind conditions. idea who's posing pose, end looking sets tapes, say, \"We want hire people,\" high-power posers. \"We want hire people. also evaluate people much positively overall.\" what's driving it? content speech. presence they're bringing speech. rate variables related competence, like, well-structured speech? good it? qualifications? effect things. what's affected. kinds things. People bringing true selves, basically. They're bringing themselves. bring ideas, themselves, no, know, residue them. what's driving effect, mediating effect. tell people this, bodies change minds minds change behavior, behavior change outcomes, say me, \"It feels fake.\" Right? said, fake till make it. me. want get still feel like fraud. want feel like impostor. want get feel like I'm supposed here. really resonated me, want tell little story impostor feeling like I'm supposed here. 19, really bad car accident. thrown car, rolled several times. thrown car. woke head injury rehab ward, withdrawn college, learned IQ dropped two standard deviations, traumatic. knew IQ identified smart, called gifted child. I'm taken college, keep trying go back. say, \"You're going finish college. Just, know, things do, that's going work you.\" really struggled this, say, identity taken you, core identity, smart, taken you, there's nothing leaves feeling powerless that. felt entirely powerless. worked worked, got lucky, worked, got lucky, worked. Eventually graduated college. took four years longer peers, convinced someone, angel advisor, Susan Fiske, take on, ended Princeton, like, supposed here. impostor. night first-year talk, first-year talk Princeton 20-minute talk 20 people. That's it. afraid found next day called said, \"I'm quitting.\" like, \"You quitting, took gamble you, staying. going stay, going do. going fake it. going every talk ever get asked do. going it, even terrified paralyzed out-of-body experience, moment say, 'Oh gosh, I'm it. Like, become this. actually this.'\" that's did. Five years grad school, years, know, I'm Northwestern, moved Harvard, I'm Harvard, I'm really thinking anymore, long time thinking, \"Not supposed here.\" end first year Harvard, student talked class entire semester, said, \"Look, gotta participate else going fail,\" came office. really know all. came totally defeated, said, \"I'm supposed here.\" moment me. two things happened. One realized, oh gosh, feel like anymore. feel anymore, does, get feeling. second was, supposed here! Like, fake it, become it. like, \"Yes, are! supposed here! tomorrow going fake it, going make powerful, and, know -- (Applause) going go classroom, going give best comment ever.\" know? gave best comment ever, people turned around like, oh God, even notice sitting there. (Laughter) comes back months later, realized faked till made it, actually faked till became it. changed. want say you, fake till make it. Fake till become it. enough actually become internalize. last thing I'm going leave this. Tiny tweaks lead big changes. So, two minutes. Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes. go next stressful evaluative situation, two minutes, try this, elevator, bathroom stall, desk behind closed doors. That's want do. Configure brain cope best situation. Get testosterone up. Get cortisol down. leave situation feeling like, oh, show am. Leave situation feeling like, really feel like got say show am. want ask first, know, try power posing, also want ask share science, simple. ego involved this. (Laughter) Give away.

I'd like suggest, number habits need move away from. I've assembled pleasure seven deadly sins speaking. I'm pretending exhaustive list, seven, think, pretty large habits fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill somebody who's present. nice habit, know perfectly well person gossiping, five minutes later, gossiping us. Second, judging. know people like conversation, hard listen somebody know judged found wanting time. Third, negativity. fall this. mother, last years life, became negative, hard listen. remember one day, said her, \"It's October 1 today,\" said, \"I know, dreadful?\" (Laughter) hard listen somebody's negative. (Laughter) another form negativity, complaining. Well, national art U.K. national sport. complain weather, sport, politics, everything, actually, complaining viral misery. spreading sunshine lightness world. Excuses. We've met guy. Maybe we've guy. people blamethrower. pass everybody else take responsibility actions, again, hard listen somebody like that. Penultimate, sixth seven, embroidery, exaggeration. demeans language, actually, sometimes. example, see something really awesome, call it? (Laughter) then, course, exaggeration becomes lying, want listen people know lying us. finally, dogmatism. confusion facts opinions. two things get conflated, listening wind. know, somebody bombarding opinions true. difficult listen that. are, seven deadly sins speaking. things think need avoid. positive way think this? Yes, is. I'd like suggest four really powerful cornerstones, foundations, stand want speech powerful make change world. Fortunately, things spell word. word \"hail,\" great definition well. I'm talking stuff falls sky hits head. I'm talking definition, greet acclaim enthusiastically, think words received stand four things. stand for? See guess. H, honesty, course, true say, straight clear. authenticity, yourself. friend mine described standing truth, think lovely way put it. integrity, word, actually say, somebody people trust. L love. mean romantic love, mean wishing people well, two reasons. First all, think absolute honesty may want. mean, goodness, look ugly morning. Perhaps that's necessary. Tempered love, course, honesty great thing. also, really wishing somebody well, hard judge time. I'm even sure two things simultaneously. hail. Also, that's say, like old song, say, also way say it. amazing toolbox. instrument incredible, yet toolbox people ever opened. I'd like little rummage pull tools might like take away play with, increase power speaking. Register, example. Now, falsetto register may useful time, there's register between. I'm going get technical voice coaches. locate voice, however. talk nose, hear difference. go throat, us speak time. want weight, need go chest. hear difference? vote politicians lower voices, true, associate depth power authority. That's register. timbre. way voice feels. Again, research shows prefer voices rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well that's you, that's end world, train. Go get voice coach. amazing things breathing, posture, exercises improve timbre voice. prosody. love prosody. sing-song, meta-language use order impart meaning. root one meaning conversation. People speak one note really quite hard listen prosody all. That's word \"monotonic\" comes from, monotonous, monotone. Also, repetitive prosody coming in, every sentence ends question actually question, statement? (Laughter) repeat one, actually restricting ability communicate prosody, think shame, let's try break habit. Pace. get excited saying something really quickly, slow right emphasize, end that, course, old friend silence. There's nothing wrong bit silence talk, there? fill ums ahs. powerful. course, pitch often goes along pace indicate arousal, pitch. leave keys? (Higher pitch) leave keys? So, slightly different meaning two deliveries. finally, volume. (Loud) get really excited using volume. Sorry that, startled anybody. Or, really pay attention getting quiet. people broadcast whole time. Try that. That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing sound people around carelessly inconsiderately. nice. course, comes play got something really important do. might standing stage like giving talk people. might proposing marriage, asking raise, wedding speech. Whatever is, really important, owe look toolbox engine going work on, engine works well without warmed up. Warm voice. Actually, let show that. Would like stand moment? I'm going show six vocal warm-up exercises every talk ever do. time going talk anybody important, these. First, arms up, deep breath in, sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One time. Ahhhh, good. we're going warm lips, we're going go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. good. now, brrrrrrrrrr, like kid. Brrrr. lips coming alive. We're going tongue next exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. getting really good this. then, roll R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne tongue. Finally, one, pros call siren. really good. starts \"we\" goes \"aw.\" \"we\" high, \"aw\" low. go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give round applause. Take seat, thank you. (Applause) Next time speak, advance. let put context close. serious point here. now, right? speak well people simply listening environment that's noise bad acoustics. talked stage different phases. would world like speaking powerfully people listening consciously environments actually fit purpose? make bit larger, would world like creating sound consciously consuming sound consciously designing environments consciously sound? would world sound beautiful, one understanding would norm, idea worth spreading.

Again, means we're listening other. conversation requires balance talking listening, somewhere along way, lost balance. Now, part due technology. smartphones either hands close enough could grab really quickly. According Pew Research, third American teenagers send hundred texts day. many them, almost them, likely text friends talk face face. There's great piece Atlantic. written high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. gave kids communication project. wanted teach speak specific subject without using notes. said this: “I came realize...” (Laughter) \"I came realize conversational competence might single overlooked skill fail teach. Kids spend hours day engaging ideas screens, rarely opportunity hone interpersonal communications skills. might sound like funny question, ask ourselves: 21st-century skill important able sustain coherent, confident conversation?\" Now, make living talking people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads state, plumbers. talk people like. talk people don’t like. talk people disagree deeply personal level. still great conversation them. I'd like spend next 10 minutes teaching talk listen. Many already heard lot advice this, things like look person eye, think interesting topics discuss advance, look, nod smile show paying attention, repeat back heard summarize it. want forget that. crap. (Laughter) reason learn show paying attention fact paying attention. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, actually use exact skills professional interviewer regular life. So, I'm going teach interview people, that's actually going help learn better conversationalists. Learn conversation without wasting time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody. We've really great conversations. We've before. know like. kind conversation walk away feeling engaged inspired, feel like made real connection perfectly understood. reason interactions can't like that. 10 basic rules. I'm going walk them, honestly, choose one master it, already enjoy better conversations. Number one: multitask. mean set cell phone tablet car keys whatever hand. mean, present. moment. think argument boss. think going dinner. want get conversation, get conversation, half half it. Number two: pontificate. want state opinion without opportunity response argument pushback growth, write blog. (Laughter) Now, there's really good reason allow pundits show: they're really boring. they're conservative, they're going hate Obama food stamps abortion. they're liberal, they're going hate big banks oil corporations Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. want like that. need enter every conversation assuming something learn. famed therapist M. Scott Peck said true listening requires setting aside oneself. sometimes means setting aside personal opinion. said sensing acceptance, speaker become less less vulnerable likely open inner recesses mind listener. Again, assume something learn. Bill Nye: \"Everyone ever meet knows something don't.\" put way: Everybody expert something. Number three: Use open-ended questions. case, take cue journalists. Start questions who, what, when, where, how. put complicated question, going get simple answer out. ask you, \"Were terrified?\" going respond powerful word sentence, \"terrified,\" answer \"Yes, was\" \"No, wasn't.\" \"Were angry?\" \"Yes, angry.\" Let describe it. They're ones know. Try asking things like, \"What like?\" \"How feel?\" might stop moment think it, going get much interesting response. Number four: Go flow. means thoughts come mind need let go mind. We've heard interviews often guest talking several minutes host comes back asks question seems like comes nowhere, already answered. means host probably stopped listening two minutes ago thought really clever question, bound determined say that. exact thing. We're sitting conversation someone, remember time met Hugh Jackman coffee shop. (Laughter) stop listening. Stories ideas going come you. need let come let go. Number five: know, say know. Now, people radio, especially NPR, much aware they're going record, they're careful claim expert claim know sure. that. Err side caution. Talk cheap. Number six: equate experience theirs. they're talking lost family member, start talking time lost family member. they're talking trouble they're work, tell much hate job. same. never same. experiences individual. And, importantly, you. need take moment prove amazing much suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking IQ was, said, \"I idea. People brag IQs losers.\" (Laughter) Conversations promotional opportunity. Number seven: Try repeat yourself. condescending, really boring, tend lot. Especially work conversations conversations kids, point make, keep rephrasing over. that. Number eight: Stay weeds. Frankly, people care years, names, dates, details struggling come mind. care. care you. care like, common. forget details. Leave out. Number nine: last one, important one. Listen. cannot tell many really important people said listening perhaps most, number one important skill could develop. Buddha said, I'm paraphrasing, \"If mouth open, learning.\" Calvin Coolidge said, \"No man ever listened way job.\" (Laughter) listen other? Number one, we'd rather talk. I'm talking, I'm control. hear anything I'm interested in. I'm center attention. bolster identity. there's another reason: get distracted. average person talks 225 word per minute, listen 500 words per minute. minds filling 275 words. look, know, takes effort energy actually pay attention someone, can't that, conversation. two people shouting barely related sentences place. (Laughter) listen one another. Stephen Covey said beautifully. said, \"Most us listen intent understand. listen intent reply.\" One rule, number 10, it’s one: brief. interested people. know, grew famous grandfather, kind ritual home. People would come talk grandparents, would leave, mother would come us, she’d say, “Do know was? runner-up Miss America. mayor Sacramento. Pulitzer Prize. He's Russian ballet dancer.\" kind grew assuming everyone hidden, amazing thing them. honestly, think makes better host. keep mouth shut often possibly can. keep mind open. I’m always prepared amazed, I'm never disappointed. thing. Go out, talk people, listen people, and, importantly, prepared amazed. Thanks. (Applause)\n",
            "What makes us feel good about our work? | Dan Ariely \n",
            " Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast want talk little bit today labor work. think people work, naive intuition people like rats maze -- people care money, moment give money, direct work one way, direct work another way. give bonuses bankers pay kinds ways. really incredibly simplistic view people work, labor market looks like. time, think it, there's kinds strange behaviors world around us. Think something like mountaineering mountain climbing. read books people climb mountains, difficult mountains, think books full moments joy happiness? No, full misery. fact, frostbite difficulty walking, difficulty breathing -- cold, challenging circumstances. people trying happy, moment would get top, would say, \"This terrible mistake. I'll never again.\" (Laughter) \"Instead, let sit beach somewhere drinking mojitos.\" instead, people go down, recover, go again. think mountain climbing example, suggests kinds things. suggests care reaching end, peak. suggests care fight, challenge. suggests there's kinds things motivate us work behave kinds ways. personally, started thinking student came visit me. one students years earlier, came one day back campus. told following story: said two weeks, working PowerPoint presentation. working big bank, preparation merger acquisition. working hard presentation -- graphs, tables, information. stayed late night every day. day due, sent PowerPoint presentation boss, boss wrote back said, \"Nice presentation, merger canceled.\" guy deeply depressed. moment working, actually quite happy. Every night enjoying work, staying late, perfecting PowerPoint presentation. knowing nobody would ever watch made quite depressed. started thinking experiment idea fruits labor. start with, created little experiment gave people Legos, asked build Legos. people, gave Legos said, \"Hey, would like build Bionicle three dollars? We'll pay three dollars it.\" people said yes, built Legos. finished, took it, put table, said, \"Would like build another one, time $2.70?\" said yes, gave another one, finished, asked them, \"Do want build another one?\" $2.40, $2.10, on, point people said, \"No more. worth me.\" called meaningful condition. People built one Bionicle another. finished every one them, put table. told end experiment, take Bionicles, disassemble them, put back boxes, use next participant. another condition. condition inspired David, student. condition called Sisyphic condition. remember story Sisyphus, Sisyphus punished gods push rock hill, almost got end, rock would roll over, would start again. think essence futile work. imagine pushed rock different hills, least would sense progress. Also, look prison movies, sometimes way guards torture prisoners get dig hole, prisoner finished, ask fill hole back dig again. There's something cyclical version something seems particularly demotivating. second condition experiment, that's exactly did. asked people, \"Would like build one Bionicle three dollars?\" said yes, built it. asked them, \"Do want build another one $2.70?\" said yes, gave new one, building it, took apart one finished. finished that, said, \"Would like build another one, time 30 cents less?\" said yes, gave one built broke. endless cycle building, us destroying front eyes. happens compare two conditions? first thing happened people built many Bionicles -- eleven meaningful condition, versus seven Sisyphus condition. way, point big meaning. People curing cancer building bridges. People building Bionicles cents. that, everybody knew Bionicles would destroyed quite soon. real opportunity big meaning. even small meaning made difference. another version experiment. version experiment, put people situation, described situation, much describing now, asked predict result would be. happened? People predicted right direction right magnitude. People given description experiment said meaningful condition, people would probably build one Bionicle. people understand meaning important, understand magnitude importance, extent important. one piece data looked at. think it, people love Legos, people don't. would speculate people love Legos would build Legos, even less money, all, get internal joy it. people love Legos less would build less Legos enjoyment derive lower. that's actually found meaningful condition. nice correlation love Legos amount Legos people built. happened Sisyphic condition? condition, correlation zero -- relationship love Legos, much people built, suggests manipulation breaking things front people's eyes, basically crushed joy could get activity. basically eliminated it. Soon finished running experiment, went talk big software company Seattle. can't tell were, big company Seattle. group within software company put different building, asked innovate, create next big product company. week showed up, CEO big software company went group, 200 engineers, canceled project. stood front 200 depressed people I've ever talked to. described Lego experiments, said felt like experiment. asked them, said, \"How many show work later used to?\" everybody raised hand. said, \"How many go home earlier used to?\" Everybody raised hand. asked them, \"How many add not-so-kosher things expense reports?\" raise hands, took dinner showed could expense reports. asked them, said, \"What could CEO done make depressed?\" came kinds ideas. said CEO could asked present whole company journey last two years decided do. could asked think aspect technology could fit parts organization. could asked build next-generation prototypes, see would work. thing one would require effort motivation. think CEO basically understand importance meaning. CEO, like participants, thought essence meaning unimportant, [wouldn't] care. would say, \"At moment directed way, I'm directing way, everything okay.\" understood important meaning is, would figure actually important spend time, energy effort getting people care they're doing. next experiment slightly different. took sheet paper random letters, asked people find pairs letters identical next other. task. People first sheet, asked wanted another little less money, next sheet little bit less, forth. three conditions. first condition, people wrote name sheet, found pairs letters, gave experimenter, experimenter would look it, scan top bottom, say \"Uh huh,\" put pile next them. second condition, people write name it. experimenter looked it, took sheet paper, look it, scan it, simply put pile pages. take piece, put side. third condition, experimenter got sheet paper, put directly shredder. (Laughter) happened three conditions? plot I'm showing pay rate people stopped. low numbers mean people worked harder. worked much longer. acknowledged condition, people worked way 15 cents. 15 cents per page, basically stopped efforts. shredder condition, twice much -- 30 cents per sheet. basically result before. shred people's efforts, output -- get happy they're doing. point out, way, shredder condition, people could cheated. could done good work, realized people shredding it. maybe first sheet good work, see nobody really testing it, would more. fact, shredder condition, people could submitted work gotten money, put less effort it. ignored condition? Would ignored condition like acknowledged like shredder, somewhere middle? turns almost like shredder. there's good news bad news here. bad news ignoring performance people almost bad shredding effort front eyes. Ignoring gets whole way there. good news simply looking something somebody done, scanning saying \"Uh huh,\" seems quite sufficient dramatically improve people's motivations. good news adding motivation seem difficult. bad news eliminating motivations seems incredibly easy, think carefully, might overdo it. terms negative motivation, eliminating negative motivation. next part want show something positive motivation. store U.S. called IKEA. IKEA store kind okay furniture takes long time assemble. (Laughter) know you, every time assemble one those, takes much longer, much effortful, much confusing, put things wrong way -- can't say enjoy pieces. can't say enjoy process. finish it, seem like IKEA pieces furniture like ones. (Laughter) there's old story cake mixes. started cake mixes '40s, would take powder would put box, would ask housewives basically pour in, stir water it, mix it, put oven, -- voila -- cake. turns unpopular. People want them, thought kinds reasons that. Maybe taste good? No, taste great. figured enough effort involved. easy nobody could serve cake guests say, \"Here cake.\" No, somebody else's cake, bought store. really feel like own. do? took eggs milk powder. (Laughter) break eggs add them, measure milk add it, mixing it. cake. everything fine. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, think little bit like IKEA effect, getting people work harder, actually got love they're higher degree. look question experimentally? asked people build origami. gave instructions create origami, gave sheet paper. novices, built something really quite ugly -- nothing like frog crane. told them, \"Look, origami really belongs us. worked us, I'll tell what, we'll sell you. much want pay it?\" measured much willing pay it. two types people: people built it, people build it, looked external observers. found builders thought beautiful pieces origami -- (Laughter) willing pay five times people evaluated externally. could say -- builder, think [you'd say], \"Oh, love origami, know nobody else would love it?\" \"I love origami, everybody else love well?\" one two correct? Turns builders loved origami more, thought everybody would see world view. thought everybody else would love well. next version, tried IKEA effect. tried make difficult. people, gave task. people, made harder hiding instructions. top sheet, little diagrams fold origami. people, eliminated that. tougher. happened? Well objective way, origami uglier, difficult. looked easy origami, saw thing -- builders loved more, evaluators loved less. looked hard instructions, effect larger. Why? builders loved even more. (Laughter) put extra effort it. evaluators? loved even less. reality, even uglier first version. (Laughter) course, tells something evaluate things. think kids. Imagine asked you, \"How much would sell kids for?\" memories associations on. people would say lot, lot money. (Laughter) good days. (Laughter) imagine slightly different. Imagine kids. one day went park met kids. like kids, played hours, leave, parents said, \"Hey, way, leave, interested, they're sale.\" (Laughter) much would pay now? people say much. kids valuable, are, us, connected us, time connection. way, think IKEA instructions good, instructions come kids, really tough. (Laughter) way, kids, which, course, wonderful on. comes tell one thing, is, much like builders, look creature creation, see people see things way. Let say one last comment. think Adam Smith versus Karl Marx, Adam Smith important notion efficiency. gave example pin factory. said pins 12 different steps, one person 12 steps, production low. get one person step one, one person step two step three on, production increase tremendously. indeed, great example, reason Industrial Revolution efficiency. Karl Marx, hand, said alienation labor incredibly important people think connection doing. 12 steps, care pin. one step every time, maybe care much. think Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith correct Karl Marx. reality we've switched, we're knowledge economy. ask yourself, happens knowledge economy? efficiency still important meaning? think answer no. think move situations people decide much effort, attention, caring, connected feel it, thinking labor way work, shower on, sudden Marx things say us. think labor, usually think motivation payment thing, reality probably add kinds things -- meaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etc. good news added components thought -- create meaning, pride, motivation, workplace, employees -- think could get people productive happier. Thank much. (Applause)\n",

            " Transcriber: 1995, fellow named Chris Klebba decided open gym hometown Northville, Michigan. Fitness changed life, wanted others small-town Michigan experience. problem gyms intimidating. ultimate irony. go gym get shape, shape, feel like need get shape show up. That's many 50 percent gym members quit within first year, fine open gym New York LA millions people. small town, might simply run customers. many gyms try solve problem making difficult quit. feeling guilty going gym, I’m stuck paying 100 dollars month, I’m still getting thinner. Chris decided something different. Chris decided invest workers. hired overly helpful, overly friendly employees moment eager step help learn use piece equipment without making feel like judged. idea 55-year-old mom dad, who’d never gym lives, feel welcome comfortable immediately. question private equity investor is: Could really profitable? There's old joke man who's much drink looking keys streetlight. cop comes offers help asks thinks lost them. \"In park,\" comes response, \"but I'm looking light's better.\" That's little investors look companies today. know value companies driven people, focus short-term profit much easier measure. I’ve worked around private equity 25 years six continents, I've seen error thinking again. private equity, buy companies seek improve sell profit. often improvement comes form cutting costs, especially labor costs. Private equity employs roughly nine million people cut million jobs past decade. often ask company org chart figure getting fired. think investors take pride helping make companies lean, I'm worried may done job well risk starving companies people need successful. big opportunity investors, executives create rather cut good jobs. Creating good jobs focus work social impact investor. create good jobs, first need definition good job, surprisingly hard find. Spreadsheets numbers comforting, people complicated, impact investing sometimes feel squishy. Good soul, perhaps, risky pocketbook. partners work company prides using data solve problems. spent last two years looking academic research, reading case studies. interviewed human capital experts surveyed workers across hundreds companies. work, developed common sense definition good job, one correlates worker productivity helps us build better companies. is. good job worker, one, fairly treated.

Number one, worker fairly treated. spend roughly third adult lives working. whether work Marshall's Microsoft, want employer pay fairly time. many investors see worker pay zero-sum game. Whatever company gives workers must somehow come expense, Home Depot announced early COVID would offering danger pay making investments worker safety, saw market value crash billions dollars. research found 100 studies show appropriate incentives, attractive benefits like retirement accounts health care things like flexible schedules pay improved productivity, higher retention, lower hiring costs. Home Depot company that's built idea providing better service customers employing experts shop floors. People seen problem they've worked home repair construction, help fix better. Home Depot thriving today thanks investment workers. fair pay critical, critical thing, thing matters. brings us second condition: promising future. Fast food restaurants pay low wages, also offer little terms learning growth, employees quit six 12 months average. Think next time get rude service drive-thru window. training career path help solve riddle. Restaurants like Tender Greens California Boloko Boston offer training low-wage workers qualifies management roles. might start dishwasher earning 12 bucks hour right training, become restaurant manager matter months, making nearly three times much. prospect tripling wage powerful motivator. data shows workers much loyal dedicated feel company helping build career. third condition, psychological safety, fairly obvious one. Think best boss ever had, one motivated go beyond work. bet person listener. modern workplace increasingly place communication collaboration. many workers find difficult risky speak up. Professor Amy Edmondson Harvard studied issue government, nonprofits companies found people's first instinct self-protect. Let's face it, life's short correct boss's mistake think might get fired result. speaking invisible, cost company valuable ideas. squander employee talent worse, put customers employees physical risk.

So, desperate freezing cold, found large rock broke basement window, cleared shards glass, crawled through, found piece cardboard taped opening, figuring morning, way airport, could call contractor ask fix it. going expensive, probably expensive middle-of-the-night locksmith, figured, circumstances, coming even. Now, I'm neuroscientist training know little bit brain performs stress. releases cortisol raises heart rate, modulates adrenaline levels clouds thinking. next morning, woke little sleep, worrying hole window, mental note call contractor, freezing temperatures, meetings upcoming Europe, and, know, cortisol brain, thinking cloudy, know cloudy thinking cloudy. (Laughter) got airport check-in counter, realized passport. (Laughter) raced home snow ice, 40 minutes, got passport, raced back airport, made time, given away seat someone else, got stuck back plane, next bathrooms, seat recline, eight-hour flight. Well, lot time think eight hours sleep. (Laughter) started wondering, things do, systems put place, prevent bad things happening? least bad things happen, minimize likelihood total catastrophe. started thinking that, thoughts crystallize month later. dinner colleague, Danny Kahneman, Nobel Prize winner, somewhat embarrassedly told broken window, and, know, forgotten passport, Danny shared he'd practicing something called prospective hindsight. (Laughter) something gotten psychologist Gary Klein, written years before, also called pre-mortem. Now, know postmortem is. Whenever there's disaster, team experts come try figure went wrong, right? Well, pre-mortem, Danny explained, look ahead try figure things could go wrong, try figure prevent things happening, minimize damage. want talk today things form pre-mortem. obvious, obvious. I'll start obvious ones. Around home, designate place things easily lost. Now, sounds like common sense, is, there's lot science back up, based way spatial memory works. There's structure brain called hippocampus, evolved tens thousands years, keep track locations important things -- well is, fish found, stand fruit trees, friendly enemy tribes live. hippocampus part brain London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged. part brain allows squirrels find nuts. wondering, somebody actually experiment cut olfactory sense squirrels, could still find nuts. using smell, using hippocampus, exquisitely evolved mechanism brain finding things. really good things move around much, good things move around. lose car keys reading glasses passports. home, designate spot keys -- hook door, maybe decorative bowl. passport, particular drawer. reading glasses, particular table. designate spot scrupulous it, things always look them. travel? Take cell phone picture credit cards, driver's license, passport, mail cloud. things lost stolen, facilitate replacement. rather obvious things. Remember, stress, brain releases cortisol. Cortisol toxic, causes cloudy thinking. part practice pre-mortem recognize stress going best, put systems place. there's perhaps stressful situation confronted medical decision make. point, us going position, make important decision future medical care loved one, help decision. want talk that. I'm going talk particular medical condition. stands proxy kinds medical decision-making, indeed financial decision-making, social decision-making -- kind decision make would benefit rational assessment facts. suppose go doctor doctor says, \"I got lab work back, cholesterol's little high.\" Now, know high cholesterol associated increased risk cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke. thinking high cholesterol best thing, doctor says, \"You know, I'd like give drug help lower cholesterol, statin.\" probably heard statins, know they're among widely prescribed drugs world today, probably even know people take them. thinking, \"Yeah! Give statin.\" there's question ask point, statistic ask doctors like talking about, pharmaceutical companies like talking even less. number needed treat. Now, this, NNT? number people need take drug undergo surgery medical procedure one person helped. thinking, kind crazy statistic that? number one. doctor prescribe something going help. actually, medical practice work way. doctor's fault, anybody's fault, fault scientists like me. figured underlying mechanisms well enough. GlaxoSmithKline estimates 90 percent drugs work 30 50 percent people. number needed treat widely prescribed statin, suppose is? many people take one person helped? 300. according research research practitioners Jerome Groopman Pamela Hartzband, independently confirmed Bloomberg.com. ran numbers myself. 300 people take drug year one heart attack, stroke adverse event prevented. probably thinking, \"Well, OK, one 300 chance lowering cholesterol. not, doc? Give prescription anyway.\" ask point another statistic, is, \"Tell side effects.\" Right? particular drug, side effects occur five percent patients. include terrible things -- debilitating muscle joint pain, gastrointestinal distress -- thinking, \"Five percent, likely going happen me, I'll still take drug.\" wait minute. Remember stress thinking clearly. think going work ahead time, manufacture chain reasoning spot. 300 people take drug, right? One person's helped, five percent 300 side effects, that's 15 people. 15 times likely harmed drug helped drug. Now, I'm saying whether take statin not. I'm saying conversation doctor. Medical ethics requires it, part principle informed consent. right access kind information begin conversation whether want take risks not. might thinking I've pulled number air shock value, fact rather typical, number needed treat. widely performed surgery men age 50, removal prostate cancer, number needed treat 49. That's right, 49 surgeries done every one person who's helped. side effects case occur 50 percent patients. include impotence, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence. lucky, one 50 percent these, they'll last year two. idea pre-mortem think ahead time questions might able ask push conversation forward. want manufacture spot. also want think things like quality life. choice oftentimes, want shorter life that's pain-free, longer life might great deal pain towards end? things talk think now, family loved ones. might change mind heat moment, least practiced kind thinking. Remember, brain stress releases cortisol, one things happens moment whole bunch systems shut down. There's evolutionary reason this. Face-to-face predator, need digestive system, libido, immune system, body expending metabolism things react quickly, might become lion's lunch, none things matter. Unfortunately, one things goes window times stress rational, logical thinking, Danny Kahneman colleagues shown. need train think ahead kinds situations. think important point recognizing us flawed. going fail then. idea think ahead failures might be, put systems place help minimize damage, prevent bad things happening first place. Getting back snowy night Montreal, got back trip, contractor install combination lock next door, key front door it, easy remember combination. admit, still piles mail sorted, piles emails gone through.

            " Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast want start offering free no-tech life hack, requires this: change posture two minutes. give away, want ask right little audit body body. many sort making smaller? Maybe hunching, crossing legs, maybe wrapping ankles. Sometimes hold onto arms like this. Sometimes spread out. (Laughter) see you. want pay attention right now. We're going come back minutes, I'm hoping learn tweak little bit, could significantly change way life unfolds. So, we're really fascinated body language, we're particularly interested people's body language. know, we're interested in, like, know — (Laughter) — awkward interaction, smile, contemptuous glance, maybe awkward wink, maybe even something like handshake. Narrator: arriving Number 10. lucky policeman gets shake hands President United States. comes Prime Minister -- No. (Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter) (Applause) Amy Cuddy: handshake, lack handshake, us talking weeks weeks weeks. Even BBC New York Times. obviously think nonverbal behavior, body language -- call nonverbals social scientists -- language, think communication. think communication, think interactions. body language communicating me? What's mine communicating you? there's lot reason believe valid way look this. social scientists spent lot time looking effects body language, people's body language, judgments. make sweeping judgments inferences body language. judgments predict really meaningful life outcomes like hire promote, ask date. example, Nalini Ambady, researcher Tufts University, shows people watch 30-second soundless clips real physician-patient interactions, judgments physician's niceness predict whether physician sued. much whether physician incompetent, like person interacted? Even dramatic, Alex Todorov Princeton shown us judgments political candidates' faces one second predict 70 percent U.S. Senate gubernatorial race outcomes, even, let's go digital, emoticons used well online negotiations lead claim value negotiation. use poorly, bad idea. Right? think nonverbals, think judge others, judge us outcomes are. tend forget, though, audience that's influenced nonverbals, that's ourselves. also influenced nonverbals, thoughts feelings physiology. nonverbals talking about? I'm social psychologist. study prejudice, teach competitive business school, inevitable would become interested power dynamics. became especially interested nonverbal expressions power dominance. nonverbal expressions power dominance? Well, are. animal kingdom, expanding. make big, stretch out, take space, basically opening up. opening up. true across animal kingdom. limited primates. humans thing. (Laughter) power sort chronically, also they're feeling powerful moment. one especially interesting really shows us universal old expressions power are. expression, known pride, Jessica Tracy studied. shows people born sight people congenitally blind win physical competition. cross finish line they've won, matter they've never seen anyone it. this. arms V, chin slightly lifted. feel powerless? exactly opposite. close up. wrap up. make small. want bump person next us. again, animals humans thing. happens put together high low power. tend comes power complement other's nonverbals. someone really powerful us, tend make smaller. mirror them. opposite them. I'm watching behavior classroom, notice? notice MBA students really exhibit full range power nonverbals. people like caricatures alphas, really coming room, get right middle room class even starts, like really want occupy space. sit down, they're sort spread out. raise hands like this. people virtually collapsing come in. soon come in, see it. see faces bodies, sit chair make tiny, go like raise hand. notice couple things this. One, going surprised. seems related gender. women much likely kind thing men. Women feel chronically less powerful men, surprising. thing noticed also seemed related extent students participating, well participating. really important MBA classroom, participation counts half grade. business schools struggling gender grade gap. get equally qualified women men coming get differences grades, seems partly attributable participation. started wonder, know, okay, people coming like this, they're participating. possible could get people fake would lead participate more? main collaborator Dana Carney, who's Berkeley, really wanted know, fake till make it? Like, little actually experience behavioral outcome makes seem powerful? know nonverbals govern people think feel us. There's lot evidence. question really was, nonverbals govern think feel ourselves? There's evidence do. So, example, smile feel happy, also, we're forced smile holding pen teeth like this, makes us feel happy. goes ways. comes power, also goes ways. feel powerful, likely this, also possible pretend powerful, likely actually feel powerful. second question really was, know, know minds change bodies, also true bodies change minds? say minds, case powerful, talking about? I'm talking thoughts feelings sort physiological things make thoughts feelings, case, that's hormones. look hormones. minds powerful versus powerless look like? powerful people tend be, surprisingly, assertive confident, optimistic. actually feel they're going win even games chance. also tend able think abstractly. lot differences. take risks. lot differences powerful powerless people. Physiologically, also differences two key hormones: testosterone, dominance hormone, cortisol, stress hormone. find high-power alpha males primate hierarchies high testosterone low cortisol, powerful effective leaders also high testosterone low cortisol. mean? think power, people tended think testosterone, dominance. really, power also react stress. want high-power leader that's dominant, high testosterone, really stress reactive? Probably not, right? want person who's powerful assertive dominant, stress reactive, person who's laid back. know primate hierarchies, alpha needs take over, individual needs take alpha role sort suddenly, within days, individual's testosterone gone significantly cortisol dropped significantly. evidence, body shape mind, least facial level, also role changes shape mind. happens, okay, take role change, happens really minimal level, like tiny manipulation, tiny intervention? \"For two minutes,\" say, \"I want stand like this, going make feel powerful.\" did. decided bring people lab run little experiment, people adopted, two minutes, either high-power poses low-power poses, I'm going show five poses, although took two. here's one. couple more. one dubbed \"Wonder Woman\" media. couple more. standing sitting. low-power poses. folding up, making small. one low-power. touching neck, really protecting yourself. happens. come in, spit vial, two minutes, say, \"You need this.\" look pictures poses. want prime concept power. want feeling power. two minutes this. ask them, \"How powerful feel?\" series items, give opportunity gamble, take another saliva sample. That's it. That's whole experiment. find. Risk tolerance, gambling, find high-power pose condition, 86 percent gamble. low-power pose condition, 60 percent, that's whopping significant difference. Here's find testosterone. baseline come in, high-power people experience 20-percent increase, low-power people experience 10-percent decrease. again, two minutes, get changes. Here's get cortisol. High-power people experience 25-percent decrease, low-power people experience 15-percent increase. two minutes lead hormonal changes configure brain basically either assertive, confident comfortable, really stress-reactive, feeling sort shut down. we've feeling, right? seems nonverbals govern think feel ourselves, others, also ourselves. Also, bodies change minds. next question, course, is, power posing minutes really change life meaningful ways? lab, little task, couple minutes. actually apply this? cared about, course. think want use evaluative situations, like social threat situations. evaluated, either friends? teenagers, lunchroom table. people speaking school board meeting. might giving pitch giving talk like job interview. decided one people could relate people through, job interview. published findings, media it, say, Okay, go job interview, right? (Laughter) know, course horrified, said, Oh God, no, that's meant all. numerous reasons, no, that. Again, talking people. talking yourself. go job interview? this. sitting down. looking iPhone -- Android, trying leave anyone out. looking notes, hunching up, making small, really maybe this, like, bathroom, right? that. Find two minutes. that's want test. Okay? bring people lab, either high- low-power poses again, go stressful job interview. five minutes long. recorded. They're judged also, judges trained give nonverbal feedback, look like this. Imagine person interviewing you. five minutes, nothing, worse heckled. People hate this. Marianne LaFrance calls \"standing social quicksand.\" really spikes cortisol. job interview put through, really wanted see happened. coders look tapes, four them. They're blind hypothesis. They're blind conditions. idea who's posing pose, end looking sets tapes, say, \"We want hire people,\" high-power posers. \"We want hire people. also evaluate people much positively overall.\" what's driving it? content speech. presence they're bringing speech. rate variables related competence, like, well-structured speech? good it? qualifications? effect things. what's affected. kinds things. People bringing true selves, basically. They're bringing themselves. bring ideas, themselves, no, know, residue them. what's driving effect, mediating effect. tell people this, bodies change minds minds change behavior, behavior change outcomes, say me, \"It feels fake.\" Right? said, fake till make it. me. want get still feel like fraud. want feel like impostor. want get feel like I'm supposed here. really resonated me, want tell little story impostor feeling like I'm supposed here. 19, really bad car accident. thrown car, rolled several times. thrown car. woke head injury rehab ward, withdrawn college, learned IQ dropped two standard deviations, traumatic. knew IQ identified smart, called gifted child. I'm taken college, keep trying go back. say, \"You're going finish college. Just, know, things do, that's going work you.\" really struggled this, say, identity taken you, core identity, smart, taken you, there's nothing leaves feeling powerless that. felt entirely powerless. worked worked, got lucky, worked, got lucky, worked. Eventually graduated college. took four years longer peers, convinced someone, angel advisor, Susan Fiske, take on, ended Princeton, like, supposed here. impostor. night first-year talk, first-year talk Princeton 20-minute talk 20 people. That's it. afraid found next day called said, \"I'm quitting.\" like, \"You quitting, took gamble you, staying. going stay, going do. going fake it. going every talk ever get asked do. going it, even terrified paralyzed out-of-body experience, moment say, 'Oh gosh, I'm it. Like, become this. actually this.'\" that's did. Five years grad school, years, know, I'm Northwestern, moved Harvard, I'm Harvard, I'm really thinking anymore, long time thinking, \"Not supposed here.\" end first year Harvard, student talked class entire semester, said, \"Look, gotta participate else going fail,\" came office. really know all. came totally defeated, said, \"I'm supposed here.\" moment me. two things happened. One realized, oh gosh, feel like anymore. feel anymore, does, get feeling. second was, supposed here! Like, fake it, become it. like, \"Yes, are! supposed here! tomorrow going fake it, going make powerful, and, know -- (Applause) going go classroom, going give best comment ever.\" know? gave best comment ever, people turned around like, oh God, even notice sitting there. (Laughter) comes back months later, realized faked till made it, actually faked till became it. changed. want say you, fake till make it. Fake till become it. enough actually become internalize. last thing I'm going leave this. Tiny tweaks lead big changes. So, two minutes. Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes. go next stressful evaluative situation, two minutes, try this, elevator, bathroom stall, desk behind closed doors. That's want do. Configure brain cope best situation. Get testosterone up. Get cortisol down. leave situation feeling like, oh, show am. Leave situation feeling like, really feel like got say show am. want ask first, know, try power posing, also want ask share science, simple. ego involved this. (Laughter) Give away.

            " human voice: instrument play. powerful sound world, probably. one start war say \"I love you.\" yet many people experience speak, people listen them. that? speak powerfully make change world? I'd like suggest, number habits need move away from. I've assembled pleasure seven deadly sins speaking. I'm pretending exhaustive list, seven, think, pretty large habits fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill somebody who's present. nice habit, know perfectly well person gossiping, five minutes later, gossiping us. Second, judging. know people like conversation, hard listen somebody know judged found wanting time. Third, negativity. fall this. mother, last years life, became negative, hard listen. remember one day, said her, \"It's October 1 today,\" said, \"I know, dreadful?\" (Laughter) hard listen somebody's negative. (Laughter) another form negativity, complaining. Well, national art U.K. national sport. complain weather, sport, politics, everything, actually, complaining viral misery. spreading sunshine lightness world. Excuses. We've met guy. Maybe we've guy. people blamethrower. pass everybody else take responsibility actions, again, hard listen somebody like that. Penultimate, sixth seven, embroidery, exaggeration. demeans language, actually, sometimes. example, see something really awesome, call it? (Laughter) then, course, exaggeration becomes lying, want listen people know lying us. finally, dogmatism. confusion facts opinions. two things get conflated, listening wind. know, somebody bombarding opinions true. difficult listen that. are, seven deadly sins speaking. things think need avoid. positive way think this? Yes, is. I'd like suggest four really powerful cornerstones, foundations, stand want speech powerful make change world. Fortunately, things spell word. word \"hail,\" great definition well. I'm talking stuff falls sky hits head. I'm talking definition, greet acclaim enthusiastically, think words received stand four things. stand for? See guess. H, honesty, course, true say, straight clear. authenticity, yourself. friend mine described standing truth, think lovely way put it. integrity, word, actually say, somebody people trust. L love. mean romantic love, mean wishing people well, two reasons. First all, think absolute honesty may want. mean, goodness, look ugly morning. Perhaps that's necessary. Tempered love, course, honesty great thing. also, really wishing somebody well, hard judge time. I'm even sure two things simultaneously. hail. Also, that's say, like old song, say, also way say it. amazing toolbox. instrument incredible, yet toolbox people ever opened. I'd like little rummage pull tools might like take away play with, increase power speaking. Register, example. Now, falsetto register may useful time, there's register between. I'm going get technical voice coaches. locate voice, however. talk nose, hear difference. go throat, us speak time. want weight, need go chest. hear difference? vote politicians lower voices, true, associate depth power authority. That's register. timbre. way voice feels. Again, research shows prefer voices rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well that's you, that's end world, train. Go get voice coach. amazing things breathing, posture, exercises improve timbre voice. prosody. love prosody. sing-song, meta-language use order impart meaning. root one meaning conversation. People speak one note really quite hard listen prosody all. That's word \"monotonic\" comes from, monotonous, monotone. Also, repetitive prosody coming in, every sentence ends question actually question, statement? (Laughter) repeat one, actually restricting ability communicate prosody, think shame, let's try break habit. Pace. get excited saying something really quickly, slow right emphasize, end that, course, old friend silence. There's nothing wrong bit silence talk, there? fill ums ahs. powerful. course, pitch often goes along pace indicate arousal, pitch. leave keys? (Higher pitch) leave keys? So, slightly different meaning two deliveries. finally, volume. (Loud) get really excited using volume. Sorry that, startled anybody. Or, really pay attention getting quiet. people broadcast whole time. Try that. That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing sound people around carelessly inconsiderately. nice. course, comes play got something really important do. might standing stage like giving talk people. might proposing marriage, asking raise, wedding speech. Whatever is, really important, owe look toolbox engine going work on, engine works well without warmed up. Warm voice. Actually, let show that. Would like stand moment? I'm going show six vocal warm-up exercises every talk ever do. time going talk anybody important, these. First, arms up, deep breath in, sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One time. Ahhhh, good. we're going warm lips, we're going go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. good. now, brrrrrrrrrr, like kid. Brrrr. lips coming alive. We're going tongue next exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. getting really good this. then, roll R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne tongue. Finally, one, pros call siren. really good. starts \"we\" goes \"aw.\" \"we\" high, \"aw\" low. go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give round applause. Take seat, thank you. (Applause) Next time speak, advance. let put context close. serious point here. now, right? speak well people simply listening environment that's noise bad acoustics. talked stage different phases. would world like speaking powerfully people listening consciously environments actually fit purpose? make bit larger, would world like creating sound consciously consuming sound consciously designing environments consciously sound? would world sound beautiful, one understanding would norm, idea worth spreading.

Pew Research study 10,000 American adults, found moment, polarized, divided, ever history. We're less likely compromise, means we're listening other. make decisions live, marry even friends going be, based already believe. Again, means we're listening other. conversation requires balance talking listening, somewhere along way, lost balance. Now, part due technology. smartphones either hands close enough could grab really quickly. According Pew Research, third American teenagers send hundred texts day. many them, almost them, likely text friends talk face face. There's great piece Atlantic. written high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. gave kids communication project. wanted teach speak specific subject without using notes. said this: “I came realize...” (Laughter) \"I came realize conversational competence might single overlooked skill fail teach. Kids spend hours day engaging ideas screens, rarely opportunity hone interpersonal communications skills. might sound like funny question, ask ourselves: 21st-century skill important able sustain coherent, confident conversation?\" Now, make living talking people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads state, plumbers. talk people like. talk people don’t like. talk people disagree deeply personal level. still great conversation them. I'd like spend next 10 minutes teaching talk listen. Many already heard lot advice this, things like look person eye, think interesting topics discuss advance, look, nod smile show paying attention, repeat back heard summarize it. want forget that. crap. (Laughter) reason learn show paying attention fact paying attention. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, actually use exact skills professional interviewer regular life. So, I'm going teach interview people, that's actually going help learn better conversationalists. Learn conversation without wasting time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody. We've really great conversations. We've before. know like. kind conversation walk away feeling engaged inspired, feel like made real connection perfectly understood. reason interactions can't like that. 10 basic rules. I'm going walk them, honestly, choose one master it, already enjoy better conversations. Number one: multitask. mean set cell phone tablet car keys whatever hand. mean, present. moment. think argument boss. think going dinner. want get conversation, get conversation, half half it. Number two: pontificate. want state opinion without opportunity response argument pushback growth, write blog. (Laughter) Now, there's really good reason allow pundits show: they're really boring. they're conservative, they're going hate Obama food stamps abortion. they're liberal, they're going hate big banks oil corporations Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. want like that. need enter every conversation assuming something learn. famed therapist M. Scott Peck said true listening requires setting aside oneself. sometimes means setting aside personal opinion. said sensing acceptance, speaker become less less vulnerable likely open inner recesses mind listener. Again, assume something learn. Bill Nye: \"Everyone ever meet knows something don't.\" put way: Everybody expert something. Number three: Use open-ended questions. case, take cue journalists. Start questions who, what, when, where, how. put complicated question, going get simple answer out. ask you, \"Were terrified?\" going respond powerful word sentence, \"terrified,\" answer \"Yes, was\" \"No, wasn't.\" \"Were angry?\" \"Yes, angry.\" Let describe it. They're ones know. Try asking things like, \"What like?\" \"How feel?\" might stop moment think it, going get much interesting response. Number four: Go flow. means thoughts come mind need let go mind. We've heard interviews often guest talking several minutes host comes back asks question seems like comes nowhere, already answered. means host probably stopped listening two minutes ago thought really clever question, bound determined say that. exact thing. We're sitting conversation someone, remember time met Hugh Jackman coffee shop. (Laughter) stop listening. Stories ideas going come you. need let come let go. Number five: know, say know. Now, people radio, especially NPR, much aware they're going record, they're careful claim expert claim know sure. that. Err side caution. Talk cheap. Number six: equate experience theirs. they're talking lost family member, start talking time lost family member. they're talking trouble they're work, tell much hate job. same. never same. experiences individual. And, importantly, you. need take moment prove amazing much suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking IQ was, said, \"I idea. People brag IQs losers.\" (Laughter) Conversations promotional opportunity. Number seven: Try repeat yourself. condescending, really boring, tend lot. Especially work conversations conversations kids, point make, keep rephrasing over. that. Number eight: Stay weeds. Frankly, people care years, names, dates, details struggling come mind. care. care you. care like, common. forget details. Leave out. Number nine: last one, important one. Listen. cannot tell many really important people said listening perhaps most, number one important skill could develop. Buddha said, I'm paraphrasing, \"If mouth open, learning.\" Calvin Coolidge said, \"No man ever listened way job.\" (Laughter) listen other? Number one, we'd rather talk. I'm talking, I'm control. hear anything I'm interested in. I'm center attention. bolster identity. there's another reason: get distracted. average person talks 225 word per minute, listen 500 words per minute. minds filling 275 words. look, know, takes effort energy actually pay attention someone, can't that, conversation. two people shouting barely related sentences place. (Laughter) listen one another. Stephen Covey said beautifully. said, \"Most us listen intent understand. listen intent reply.\" One rule, number 10, it’s one: brief. interested people. know, grew famous grandfather, kind ritual home.

            " Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast want talk little bit today labor work. think people work, naive intuition people like rats maze -- people care money, moment give money, direct work one way, direct work another way. give bonuses bankers pay kinds ways. really incredibly simplistic view people work, labor market looks like. time, think it, there's kinds strange behaviors world around us. Think something like mountaineering mountain climbing. read books people climb mountains, difficult mountains, think books full moments joy happiness? No, full misery. fact, frostbite difficulty walking, difficulty breathing -- cold, challenging circumstances. people trying happy, moment would get top, would say, \"This terrible mistake. I'll never again.\" (Laughter) \"Instead, let sit beach somewhere drinking mojitos.\" instead, people go down, recover, go again. think mountain climbing example, suggests kinds things. suggests care reaching end, peak. suggests care fight, challenge. suggests there's kinds things motivate us work behave kinds ways. personally, started thinking student came visit me. one students years earlier, came one day back campus. told following story: said two weeks, working PowerPoint presentation. working big bank, preparation merger acquisition. working hard presentation -- graphs, tables, information. stayed late night every day. day due, sent PowerPoint presentation boss, boss wrote back said, \"Nice presentation, merger canceled.\" guy deeply depressed. moment working, actually quite happy. Every night enjoying work, staying late, perfecting PowerPoint presentation. knowing nobody would ever watch made quite depressed. started thinking experiment idea fruits labor. start with, created little experiment gave people Legos, asked build Legos. people, gave Legos said, \"Hey, would like build Bionicle three dollars? We'll pay three dollars it.\" people said yes, built Legos. finished, took it, put table, said, \"Would like build another one, time $2.70?\" said yes, gave another one, finished, asked them, \"Do want build another one?\" $2.40, $2.10, on, point people said, \"No more. worth me.\" called meaningful condition. People built one Bionicle another. finished every one them, put table. told end experiment, take Bionicles, disassemble them, put back boxes, use next participant. another condition. condition inspired David, student. condition called Sisyphic condition. remember story Sisyphus, Sisyphus punished gods push rock hill, almost got end, rock would roll over, would start again. think essence futile work. imagine pushed rock different hills, least would sense progress. Also, look prison movies, sometimes way guards torture prisoners get dig hole, prisoner finished, ask fill hole back dig again. There's something cyclical version something seems particularly demotivating. second condition experiment, that's exactly did. asked people, \"Would like build one Bionicle three dollars?\" said yes, built it. asked them, \"Do want build another one $2.70?\" said yes, gave new one, building it, took apart one finished. finished that, said, \"Would like build another one, time 30 cents less?\" said yes, gave one built broke. endless cycle building, us destroying front eyes. happens compare two conditions? first thing happened people built many Bionicles -- eleven meaningful condition, versus seven Sisyphus condition. way, point big meaning. People curing cancer building bridges. People building Bionicles cents. that, everybody knew Bionicles would destroyed quite soon. real opportunity big meaning. even small meaning made difference. another version experiment. version experiment, put people situation, described situation, much describing now, asked predict result would be. happened? People predicted right direction right magnitude. People given description experiment said meaningful condition, people would probably build one Bionicle. people understand meaning important, understand magnitude importance, extent important. one piece data looked at. think it, people love Legos, people don't. would speculate people love Legos would build Legos, even less money, all, get internal joy it. people love Legos less would build less Legos enjoyment derive lower. that's actually found meaningful condition. nice correlation love Legos amount Legos people built. happened Sisyphic condition? condition, correlation zero -- relationship love Legos, much people built, suggests manipulation breaking things front people's eyes, basically crushed joy could get activity. basically eliminated it. Soon finished running experiment, went talk big software company Seattle. can't tell were, big company Seattle. group within software company put different building, asked innovate, create next big product company. week showed up, CEO big software company went group, 200 engineers, canceled project. stood front 200 depressed people I've ever talked to. described Lego experiments, said felt like experiment. asked them, said, \"How many show work later used to?\" everybody raised hand. said, \"How many go home earlier used to?\" Everybody raised hand. asked them, \"How many add not-so-kosher things expense reports?\" raise hands, took dinner showed could expense reports. asked them, said, \"What could CEO done make depressed?\" came kinds ideas. said CEO could asked present whole company journey last two years decided do. could asked think aspect technology could fit parts organization. could asked build next-generation prototypes, see would work. thing one would require effort motivation. think CEO basically understand importance meaning. CEO, like participants, thought essence meaning unimportant, [wouldn't] care. would say, \"At moment directed way, I'm directing way, everything okay.\" understood important meaning is, would figure actually important spend time, energy effort getting people care they're doing. next experiment slightly different. took sheet paper random letters, asked people find pairs letters identical next other. task. People first sheet, asked wanted another little less money, next sheet little bit less, forth. three conditions. first condition, people wrote name sheet, found pairs letters, gave experimenter, experimenter would look it, scan top bottom, say \"Uh huh,\" put pile next them. second condition, people write name it. experimenter looked it, took sheet paper, look it, scan it, simply put pile pages. take piece, put side. third condition, experimenter got sheet paper, put directly shredder. (Laughter) happened three conditions? plot I'm showing pay rate people stopped. low numbers mean people worked harder. worked much longer. acknowledged condition, people worked way 15 cents. 15 cents per page, basically stopped efforts. shredder condition, twice much -- 30 cents per sheet. basically result before. shred people's efforts, output -- get happy they're doing. point out, way, shredder condition, people could cheated. could done good work, realized people shredding it. maybe first sheet good work, see nobody really testing it, would more. fact, shredder condition, people could submitted work gotten money, put less effort it. ignored condition? Would ignored condition like acknowledged like shredder, somewhere middle? turns almost like shredder. there's good news bad news here. bad news ignoring performance people almost bad shredding effort front eyes. Ignoring gets whole way there. good news simply looking something somebody done, scanning saying \"Uh huh,\" seems quite sufficient dramatically improve people's motivations. good news adding motivation seem difficult. bad news eliminating motivations seems incredibly easy, think carefully, might overdo it. terms negative motivation, eliminating negative motivation. next part want show something positive motivation. store U.S. called IKEA. IKEA store kind okay furniture takes long time assemble. (Laughter) know you, every time assemble one those, takes much longer, much effortful, much confusing, put things wrong way -- can't say enjoy pieces. can't say enjoy process. finish it, seem like IKEA pieces furniture like ones. (Laughter) there's old story cake mixes. started cake mixes '40s, would take powder would put box, would ask housewives basically pour in, stir water it, mix it, put oven, -- voila -- cake. turns unpopular. People want them, thought kinds reasons that. Maybe taste good? No, taste great. figured enough effort involved. easy nobody could serve cake guests say, \"Here cake.\" No, somebody else's cake, bought store. really feel like own. do? took eggs milk powder. (Laughter) break eggs add them, measure milk add it, mixing it. cake. everything fine. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, think little bit like IKEA effect, getting people work harder, actually got love they're higher degree. look question experimentally? asked people build origami. gave instructions create origami, gave sheet paper. novices, built something really quite ugly -- nothing like frog crane. told them, \"Look, origami really belongs us. worked us, I'll tell what, we'll sell you. much want pay it?\" measured much willing pay it. two types people: people built it, people build it, looked external observers. found builders thought beautiful pieces origami -- (Laughter) willing pay five times people evaluated externally. could say -- builder, think [you'd say], \"Oh, love origami, know nobody else would love it?\" \"I love origami, everybody else love well?\" one two correct? Turns builders loved origami more, thought everybody would see world view. thought everybody else would love well. next version, tried IKEA effect. tried make difficult. people, gave task. people, made harder hiding instructions. top sheet, little diagrams fold origami. people, eliminated that. tougher. happened? Well objective way, origami uglier, difficult. looked easy origami, saw thing -- builders loved more, evaluators loved less. looked hard instructions, effect larger. Why? builders loved even more. (Laughter) put extra effort it. evaluators? loved even less. reality, even uglier first version. (Laughter) course, tells something evaluate things. think kids. Imagine asked you, \"How much would sell kids for?\" memories associations on. people would say lot, lot money. (Laughter) good days. (Laughter) imagine slightly different. Imagine kids. one day went park met kids. like kids, played hours, leave, parents said, \"Hey, way, leave, interested, they're sale.\" (Laughter) much would pay now? people say much. kids valuable, are, us, connected us, time connection. way, think IKEA instructions good, instructions come kids, really tough. (Laughter) way, kids, which, course, wonderful on. comes tell one thing, is, much like builders, look creature creation, see people see things way. Let say one last comment. think Adam Smith versus Karl Marx, Adam Smith important notion efficiency. gave example pin factory. said pins 12 different steps, one person 12 steps, production low. get one person step one, one person step two step three on, production increase tremendously. indeed, great example, reason Industrial Revolution efficiency. Karl Marx, hand, said alienation labor incredibly important people think connection doing. 12 steps, care pin. one step every time, maybe care much. think Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith correct Karl Marx. reality we've switched, we're knowledge economy. ask yourself, happens knowledge economy? efficiency still important meaning? think answer no. think move situations people decide much effort, attention, caring, connected feel it, thinking labor way work, shower on, sudden Marx things say us. think labor, usually think motivation payment thing, reality probably add kinds things -- meaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etc. good news added components thought -- create meaning, pride, motivation, workplace, employees -- think could get people productive happier. Thank much. (Applause)\n",

            " Transcriber: 1995, fellow named Chris Klebba decided open gym hometown Northville, Michigan. Fitness changed life, wanted others small-town Michigan experience. problem gyms intimidating. ultimate irony. go gym get shape, shape, feel like need get shape show up. That's many 50 percent gym members quit within first year, fine open gym New York LA millions people. small town, might simply run customers. many gyms try solve problem making difficult quit. feeling guilty going gym, I’m stuck paying 100 dollars month, I’m still getting thinner. Chris decided something different. Chris decided invest workers. hired overly helpful, overly friendly employees moment eager step help learn use piece equipment without making feel like judged. idea 55-year-old mom dad, who’d never gym lives, feel welcome comfortable immediately. question private equity investor is: Could really profitable? There's old joke man who's much drink looking keys streetlight. cop comes offers help asks thinks lost them. \"In park,\" comes response, \"but I'm looking light's better.\" That's little investors look companies today. know value companies driven people, focus short-term profit much easier measure. I’ve worked around private equity 25 years six continents, I've seen error thinking again. private equity, buy companies seek improve sell profit. often improvement comes form cutting costs, especially labor costs. Private equity employs roughly nine million people cut million jobs past decade. often ask company org chart figure getting fired. think investors take pride helping make companies lean, I'm worried may done job well risk starving companies people need successful. big opportunity investors, executives create rather cut good jobs. Creating good jobs focus work social impact investor. create good jobs, first need definition good job, surprisingly hard find. Spreadsheets numbers comforting, people complicated, impact investing sometimes feel squishy. Good soul, perhaps, risky pocketbook. partners work company prides using data solve problems. spent last two years looking academic research, reading case studies. interviewed human capital experts surveyed workers across hundreds companies. work, developed common sense definition good job, one correlates worker productivity helps us build better companies. is. good job worker, one, fairly treated. Two, promising future. Three, feels psychologically safe. four, sense purpose. definition, third jobs today qualify good jobs. that's data-driven impact investing help. putting hard numbers conditions, score job companies invest work improve number good jobs companies. let's go four conditions turn, do, think place work. measure up? answer \"not good,\" worry, help point company right direction. go. Number one, worker fairly treated. spend roughly third adult lives working. whether work Marshall's Microsoft, want employer pay fairly time. many investors see worker pay zero-sum game. Whatever company gives workers must somehow come expense, Home Depot announced early COVID would offering danger pay making investments worker safety, saw market value crash billions dollars. research found 100 studies show appropriate incentives, attractive benefits like retirement accounts health care things like flexible schedules pay improved productivity, higher retention, lower hiring costs. Home Depot company that's built idea providing better service customers employing experts shop floors. People seen problem they've worked home repair construction, help fix better. Home Depot thriving today thanks investment workers. fair pay critical, critical thing, thing matters. brings us second condition: promising future. Fast food restaurants pay low wages, also offer little terms learning growth, employees quit six 12 months average. Think next time get rude service drive-thru window. training career path help solve riddle. Restaurants like Tender Greens California Boloko Boston offer training low-wage workers qualifies management roles. might start dishwasher earning 12 bucks hour right training, become restaurant manager matter months, making nearly three times much. prospect tripling wage powerful motivator. data shows workers much loyal dedicated feel company helping build career. third condition, psychological safety, fairly obvious one. Think best boss ever had, one motivated go beyond work. bet person listener. modern workplace increasingly place communication collaboration. many workers find difficult risky speak up. Professor Amy Edmondson Harvard studied issue government, nonprofits companies found people's first instinct self-protect. Let's face it, life's short correct boss's mistake think might get fired result. speaking invisible, cost company valuable ideas. squander employee talent worse, put customers employees physical risk. Google found quest create perfect team important ingredient people involved rather team's overall willingness share listen. also found great teams hide mistakes, rather embrace opportunities learning add overall IQ companies. brings us purpose. lot easier share listen others colleagues feel passionately work. feel passionately idea going work day sole purpose maximizing shareholder value investors never met? energizing idea. Humans, unlike machines, want feel connected higher purpose. want feel proud useful. fortunately, companies exist reason. hard tell many mission statements read like generated robot. actually used online mission statement generator talk see would come back. \"The mission TED talk offer smart insights empathy, care thoughtfulness.\" bad computer. good mission statement nice words PowerPoint. good mission statement distilled form strategy, guiding light company employees. fitness chain mentioned earlier, Impact Fitness, clear mission offer health fitness underserved communities, they're deadly serious it. founder, Chris, likes repeat mission company meetings. gym owners would thrilled customers never showed up, long keep paying monthly bill. Chris wants people show workout gyms get healthier. That's tracked gym usage, tied executive pay. company gone strength strength, growing single gym Northville, Michigan, three dozen gyms across small-town Michigan, Indiana Canada. done way employees every reason proud of. old corporate chestnut employees valuable asset. Today words ring hollow automated voice, telling us important call we've hold 10 minutes. (Laughter) fortunately, creating good jobs rocket science. four conditions: fair treatment, promising future, psychological safety purpose relatively easy track improve. that, though, requires investors executives work together. often well-meaning CEOs cut short short-term oriented investors boards represent them. believe better measure good jobs associated benefits, investors support investments workers. wouldn’t want create good jobs creating valuable companies time? research shows companies higher proportion good jobs grow faster profitable. attract better talent innovative. Investors ignore issue peril today's economy, good jobs good society, they're good business. Thank you.\n"

(laughter) got airport check-in counter, realized passport. (laughter) raced home snow ice, 40 minutes, got passport, raced back airport, made time, given away seat someone else, got stuck back plane, next bathrooms, seat recline, eight-hour flight. well, lot time think eight hours sleep. (laughter) started wondering, things do, systems put place, prevent bad things happening? least bad things happen, minimize likelihood total catastrophe. started thinking that, thoughts crystallize month later. dinner colleague, danny kahneman, nobel prize winner, somewhat embarrassedly told broken window, and, know, forgotten passport, danny shared he'd practicing something called prospective hindsight. (laughter) something gotten psychologist gary klein, written years before, also called pre-mortem. now, know postmortem is. whenever there's disaster, team experts come try figure went wrong, right? well, pre-mortem, danny explained, look ahead try figure things could go wrong, try figure prevent things happening, minimize damage. want talk today things form pre-mortem. obvious, obvious. i'll start obvious ones. around home, designate place things easily lost. now, sounds like common sense, is, there's lot science back up, based way spatial memory works. there's structure brain called hippocampus, evolved tens thousands years, keep track locations important things -- well is, fish found, stand fruit trees, friendly enemy tribes live. hippocampus part brain london taxicab drivers becomes enlarged. part brain allows squirrels find nuts. wondering, somebody actually experiment cut olfactory sense squirrels, could still find nuts. using smell, using hippocampus, exquisitely evolved mechanism brain finding things. really good things move around much, good things move around. lose car keys reading glasses passports. home, designate spot keys -- hook door, maybe decorative bowl. passport, particular drawer. reading glasses, particular table. designate spot scrupulous it, things always look them. travel? take cell phone picture credit cards, driver's license, passport, mail cloud. things lost stolen, facilitate replacement. rather obvious things. remember, stress, brain releases cortisol. cortisol toxic, causes cloudy thinking. part practice pre-mortem recognize stress going best, put systems place. there's perhaps stressful situation confronted medical decision make. point, us going position, make important decision future medical care loved one, help decision. want talk that. i'm going talk particular medical condition. stands proxy kinds medical decision-making, indeed financial decision-making, social decision-making -- kind decision make would benefit rational assessment facts. suppose go doctor doctor says, \"i got lab work back, cholesterol's little high.\" now, know high cholesterol associated increased risk cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke. thinking high cholesterol best thing, doctor says, \"you know, i'd like give drug help lower cholesterol, statin.\" probably heard statins, know they're among widely prescribed drugs world today, probably even know people take them. thinking, \"yeah! give statin.\" there's question ask point, statistic ask doctors like talking about, pharmaceutical companies like talking even less. number needed treat. now, this, nnt? number people need take drug undergo surgery medical procedure one person helped. thinking, kind crazy statistic that? number one. doctor prescribe something going help. actually, medical practice work way. doctor's fault, anybody's fault, fault scientists like me. figured underlying mechanisms well enough. glaxosmithkline estimates 90 percent drugs work 30 50 percent people. number needed treat widely prescribed statin, suppose is? many people take one person helped? 300. according research research practitioners jerome groopman pamela hartzband, independently confirmed bloomberg.com. ran numbers myself. 300 people take drug year one heart attack, stroke adverse event prevented. probably thinking, \"well, ok, one 300 chance lowering cholesterol. not, doc? give prescription anyway.\" ask point another statistic, is, \"tell side effects.\" right? particular drug, side effects occur five percent patients. include terrible things -- debilitating muscle joint pain, gastrointestinal distress -- thinking, \"five percent, likely going happen me, i'll still take drug.\" wait minute. remember stress thinking clearly. think going work ahead time, manufacture chain reasoning spot. 300 people take drug, right? one person's helped, five percent 300 side effects, that's 15 people. 15 times likely harmed drug helped drug. now, i'm saying whether take statin not. i'm saying conversation doctor. medical ethics requires it, part principle informed consent. right access kind information begin conversation whether want take risks not. might thinking i've pulled number air shock value, fact rather typical, number needed treat. widely performed surgery men age 50, removal prostate cancer, number needed treat 49. that's right, 49 surgeries done every one person who's helped. side effects case occur 50 percent patients. include impotence, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence. lucky, one 50 percent these, they'll last year two. idea pre-mortem think ahead time questions might able ask push conversation forward. want manufacture spot. also want think things like quality life. choice oftentimes, want shorter life that's pain-free, longer life might great deal pain towards end? things talk think now, family loved ones. might change mind heat moment, least practiced kind thinking. remember, brain stress releases cortisol, one things happens moment whole bunch systems shut down. there's evolutionary reason this. face-to-face predator, need digestive system, libido, immune system, body expending metabolism things react quickly, might become lion's lunch, none things matter. unfortunately, one things goes window times stress rational, logical thinking, danny kahneman colleagues shown. need train think ahead kinds situations. think important point recognizing us flawed. going fail then. idea think ahead failures might be, put systems place help minimize damage, prevent bad things happening first place. getting back snowy night montreal, got back trip, contractor install combination lock next door, key front door it, easy remember combination. admit, still piles mail sorted, piles emails gone through. i'm completely organized, see organization gradual process, i'm getting there. thank much.

(laughter) (applause) (laughter) (applause) amy cuddy: handshake, lack handshake, us talking weeks weeks weeks. even bbc new york times. obviously think nonverbal behavior, body language -- call nonverbals social scientists -- language, think communication. think communication, think interactions. body language communicating me? what's mine communicating you? there's lot reason believe valid way look this. social scientists spent lot time looking effects body language, people's body language, judgments. make sweeping judgments inferences body language. judgments predict really meaningful life outcomes like hire promote, ask date. example, nalini ambady, researcher tufts university, shows people watch 30-second soundless clips real physician-patient interactions, judgments physician's niceness predict whether physician sued. much whether physician incompetent, like person interacted? even dramatic, alex todorov princeton shown us judgments political candidates' faces one second predict 70 percent u.s. senate gubernatorial race outcomes, even, let's go digital, emoticons used well online negotiations lead claim value negotiation. use poorly, bad idea. right? think nonverbals, think judge others, judge us outcomes are. tend forget, though, audience that's influenced nonverbals, that's ourselves. also influenced nonverbals, thoughts feelings physiology. nonverbals talking about? i'm social psychologist. study prejudice, teach competitive business school, inevitable would become interested power dynamics. became especially interested nonverbal expressions power dominance. nonverbal expressions power dominance? well, are. animal kingdom, expanding. make big, stretch out, take space, basically opening up. opening up. true across animal kingdom. limited primates. humans thing. (laughter) power sort chronically, also they're feeling powerful moment. one especially interesting really shows us universal old expressions power are. expression, known pride, jessica tracy studied. shows people born sight people congenitally blind win physical competition. cross finish line they've won, matter they've never seen anyone it. this. arms v, chin slightly lifted. feel powerless? exactly opposite. close up. wrap up. make small. want bump person next us. again, animals humans thing. happens put together high low power. tend comes power complement other's nonverbals. someone really powerful us, tend make smaller. mirror them. opposite them. i'm watching behavior classroom, notice? notice mba students really exhibit full range power nonverbals. people like caricatures alphas, really coming room, get right middle room class even starts, like really want occupy space. sit down, they're sort spread out. raise hands like this. people virtually collapsing come in. soon come in, see it. see faces bodies, sit chair make tiny, go like raise hand. notice couple things this. one, going surprised. seems related gender. women much likely kind thing men. women feel chronically less powerful men, surprising. thing noticed also seemed related extent students participating, well participating. really important mba classroom, participation counts half grade. business schools struggling gender grade gap. get equally qualified women men coming get differences grades, seems partly attributable participation. started wonder, know, okay, people coming like this, they're participating. possible could get people fake would lead participate more? main collaborator dana carney, who's berkeley, really wanted know, fake till make it? like, little actually experience behavioral outcome makes seem powerful? know nonverbals govern people think feel us. there's lot evidence. question really was, nonverbals govern think feel ourselves? there's evidence do. so, example, smile feel happy, also, we're forced smile holding pen teeth like this, makes us feel happy. goes ways. comes power, also goes ways. feel powerful, likely this, also possible pretend powerful, likely actually feel powerful. second question really was, know, know minds change bodies, also true bodies change minds? say minds, case powerful, talking about? i'm talking thoughts feelings sort physiological things make thoughts feelings, case, that's hormones. look hormones. minds powerful versus powerless look like? powerful people tend be, surprisingly, assertive confident, optimistic. actually feel they're going win even games chance. also tend able think abstractly. lot differences. take risks. lot differences powerful powerless people. physiologically, also differences two key hormones: testosterone, dominance hormone, cortisol, stress hormone. find high-power alpha males primate hierarchies high testosterone low cortisol, powerful effective leaders also high testosterone low cortisol. mean? think power, people tended think testosterone, dominance. really, power also react stress. want high-power leader that's dominant, high testosterone, really stress reactive? probably not, right? want person who's powerful assertive dominant, stress reactive, person who's laid back. know primate hierarchies, alpha needs take over, individual needs take alpha role sort suddenly, within days, individual's testosterone gone significantly cortisol dropped significantly. evidence, body shape mind, least facial level, also role changes shape mind. happens, okay, take role change, happens really minimal level, like tiny manipulation, tiny intervention? \"for two minutes,\" say, \"i want stand like this, going make feel powerful.\" did. decided bring people lab run little experiment, people adopted, two minutes, either high-power poses low-power poses, i'm going show five poses, although took two. here's one. couple more. one dubbed \"wonder woman\" media. couple more. standing sitting. low-power poses. folding up, making small. one low-power. touching neck, really protecting yourself. happens. come in, spit vial, two minutes, say, \"you need this.\" look pictures poses. want prime concept power. want feeling power. two minutes this. ask them, \"how powerful feel?\" series items, give opportunity gamble, take another saliva sample. that's it. that's whole experiment. find. risk tolerance, gambling, find high-power pose condition, 86 percent gamble. low-power pose condition, 60 percent, that's whopping significant difference. here's find testosterone. baseline come in, high-power people experience 20-percent increase, low-power people experience 10-percent decrease. again, two minutes, get changes. here's get cortisol. high-power people experience 25-percent decrease, low-power people experience 15-percent increase. two minutes lead hormonal changes configure brain basically either assertive, confident comfortable, really stress-reactive, feeling sort shut down. we've feeling, right?

we'll pay three dollars it.\" people said yes, built legos. finished, took it, put table, said, \"would like build another one, time $2.70?\" said yes, gave another one, finished, asked them, \"do want build another one?\" $2.40, $2.10, on, point people said, \"no more. worth me.\" called meaningful condition. people built one bionicle another. finished every one them, put table. told end experiment, take bionicles, disassemble them, put back boxes, use next participant. another condition. condition inspired david, student. condition called sisyphic condition. remember story sisyphus, sisyphus punished gods push rock hill, almost got end, rock would roll over, would start again. think essence futile work. imagine pushed rock different hills, least would sense progress. also, look prison movies, sometimes way guards torture prisoners get dig hole, prisoner finished, ask fill hole back dig again. there's something cyclical version something seems particularly demotivating. second condition experiment, that's exactly did. asked people, \"would like build one bionicle three dollars?\" said yes, built it. asked them, \"do want build another one $2.70?\" said yes, gave new one, building it, took apart one finished. finished that, said, \"would like build another one, time 30 cents less?\" said yes, gave one built broke. endless cycle building, us destroying front eyes. happens compare two conditions? first thing happened people built many bionicles -- eleven meaningful condition, versus seven sisyphus condition. way, point big meaning. people curing cancer building bridges. people building bionicles cents. that, everybody knew bionicles would destroyed quite soon. real opportunity big meaning. even small meaning made difference. another version experiment. version experiment, put people situation, described situation, much describing now, asked predict result would be. happened? people predicted right direction right magnitude. people given description experiment said meaningful condition, people would probably build one bionicle. people understand meaning important, understand magnitude importance, extent important. one piece data looked at. think it, people love legos, people don't. would speculate people love legos would build legos, even less money, all, get internal joy it. people love legos less would build less legos enjoyment derive lower. that's actually found meaningful condition. nice correlation love legos amount legos people built. happened sisyphic condition? condition, correlation zero -- relationship love legos, much people built, suggests manipulation breaking things front people's eyes, basically crushed joy could get activity. basically eliminated it. soon finished running experiment, went talk big software company seattle. can't tell were, big company seattle. group within software company put different building, asked innovate, create next big product company. week showed up, ceo big software company went group, 200 engineers, canceled project. stood front 200 depressed people i've ever talked to. described lego experiments, said felt like experiment. asked them, said, \"how many show work later used to?\" everybody raised hand. said, \"how many go home earlier used to?\" everybody raised hand. asked them, \"how many add not-so-kosher things expense reports?\" raise hands, took dinner showed could expense reports. asked them, said, \"what could ceo done make depressed?\" came kinds ideas. said ceo could asked present whole company journey last two years decided do. could asked think aspect technology could fit parts organization. could asked build next-generation prototypes, see would work. thing one would require effort motivation. think ceo basically understand importance meaning. ceo, like participants, thought essence meaning unimportant, [wouldn't] care. would say, \"at moment directed way, i'm directing way, everything okay.\" understood important meaning is, would figure actually important spend time, energy effort getting people care they're doing. next experiment slightly different. took sheet paper random letters, asked people find pairs letters identical next other. task. people first sheet, asked wanted another little less money, next sheet little bit less, forth. three conditions. first condition, people wrote name sheet, found pairs letters, gave experimenter, experimenter would look it, scan top bottom, say \"uh huh,\" put pile next them. second condition, people write name it. experimenter looked it, took sheet paper, look it, scan it, simply put pile pages. take piece, put side. third condition, experimenter got sheet paper, put directly shredder.

(laughter) know you, every time assemble one those, takes much longer, much effortful, much confusing, put things wrong way -- can't say enjoy pieces. can't say enjoy process. finish it, seem like ikea pieces furniture like ones. (laughter) there's old story cake mixes. started cake mixes '40s, would take powder would put box, would ask housewives basically pour in, stir water it, mix it, put oven, -- voila -- cake. turns unpopular. people want them, thought kinds reasons that. maybe taste good? no, taste great. figured enough effort involved. easy nobody could serve cake guests say, \"here cake.\" no, somebody else's cake, bought store. really feel like own. do? took eggs milk powder.

(laughter) put extra effort it. evaluators? loved even less. reality, even uglier first version. (laughter) course, tells something evaluate things. think kids. imagine asked you, \"how much would sell kids for?\" memories associations on. people would say lot, lot money. (laughter) good days. (laughter) imagine slightly different. imagine kids. one day went park met kids. like kids, played hours, leave, parents said, \"hey, way, leave, interested, they're sale.\" (laughter) much would pay now? people say much. kids valuable, are, us, connected us, time connection. way, think ikea instructions good, instructions come kids, really tough. (laughter) way, kids, which, course, wonderful on. comes tell one thing, is, much like builders, look creature creation, see people see things way. let say one last comment. think adam smith versus karl marx, adam smith important notion efficiency. gave example pin factory. said pins 12 different steps, one person 12 steps, production low. get one person step one, one person step two step three on, production increase tremendously. indeed, great example, reason industrial revolution efficiency. karl marx, hand, said alienation labor incredibly important people think connection doing. 12 steps, care pin. one step every time, maybe care much. think industrial revolution, adam smith correct karl marx. reality we've switched, we're knowledge economy. ask yourself, happens knowledge economy? efficiency still important meaning? think answer no. think move situations people decide much effort, attention, caring, connected feel it, thinking labor way work, shower on, sudden marx things say us. think labor, usually think motivation payment thing, reality probably add kinds things -- meaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etc. good news added components thought -- create meaning, pride, motivation, workplace, employees -- think could get people productive happier. thank much.

house. driven home, around midnight dead montreal winter, visiting friend, jeff, across town, thermometer front porch read minus 40 degrees -- bother asking that's celsius fahrenheit, minus 40 two scales meet -- cold. stood front porch fumbling pockets, found keys. fact, could see window, lying dining room table left them. quickly ran around tried doors windows, locked tight. thought calling locksmith -- least cellphone, midnight, could take locksmith show up, cold. go back friend jeff's house night early flight europe next morning, needed get passport suitcase. so, desperate freezing cold, found large rock broke basement window, cleared shards glass, crawled through, found piece cardboard taped opening, figuring morning, way airport, could call contractor ask fix it. going expensive, probably expensive middle-of-the-night locksmith, figured, circumstances, coming even. now, i'm neuroscientist training know little bit brain performs stress. releases cortisol raises heart rate, modulates adrenaline levels clouds thinking. next morning, woke little sleep, worrying hole window, mental note call contractor, freezing temperatures, meetings upcoming europe, and, know, cortisol brain, thinking cloudy, know cloudy thinking cloudy. (laughter) got airport check-in counter, realized passport. (laughter) raced home snow ice, 40 minutes, got passport, raced back airport, made time, given away seat someone else, got stuck back plane, next bathrooms, seat recline, eight-hour flight. well, lot time think eight hours sleep. (laughter) started wondering, things do, systems put place, prevent bad things happening? least bad things happen, minimize likelihood total catastrophe. started thinking that, thoughts crystallize month later. dinner colleague, danny kahneman, nobel prize winner, somewhat embarrassedly told broken window, and, know, forgotten passport, danny shared he'd practicing something called prospective hindsight. (laughter) something gotten psychologist gary klein, written years before, also called pre-mortem. now, know postmortem is. whenever there's disaster, team experts come try figure went wrong, right? well, pre-mortem, danny explained, look ahead try figure things could go wrong, try figure prevent things happening, minimize damage. want talk today things form pre-mortem. obvious, obvious. i'll start obvious ones. around home, designate place things easily lost. now, sounds like common sense, is, there's lot science back up, based way spatial memory works. there's structure brain called hippocampus, evolved tens thousands years, keep track locations important things -- well is, fish found, stand fruit trees, friendly enemy tribes live. hippocampus part brain london taxicab drivers becomes enlarged. part brain allows squirrels find nuts. wondering, somebody actually experiment cut olfactory sense squirrels, could still find nuts. using smell, using hippocampus, exquisitely evolved mechanism brain finding things. really good things move around much, good things move around. lose car keys reading glasses passports. home, designate spot keys -- hook door, maybe decorative bowl. passport, particular drawer. reading glasses, particular table. designate spot scrupulous it, things always look them. travel? take cell phone picture credit cards, driver's license, passport, mail cloud. things lost stolen, facilitate replacement. rather obvious things. remember, stress, brain releases cortisol. cortisol toxic, causes cloudy thinking. part practice pre-mortem recognize stress going best, put systems place. there's perhaps stressful situation confronted medical decision make. point, us going position, make important decision future medical care loved one, help decision. want talk that. i'm going talk particular medical condition. stands proxy kinds medical decision-making, indeed financial decision-making, social decision-making -- kind decision make would benefit rational assessment facts. suppose go doctor doctor says, \"i got lab work back, cholesterol's little high.\" now, know high cholesterol associated increased risk cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke. thinking high cholesterol best thing, doctor says, \"you know, i'd like give drug help lower cholesterol, statin.\" probably heard statins, know they're among widely prescribed drugs world today, probably even know people take them. thinking, \"yeah! give statin.\" there's question ask point, statistic ask doctors like talking about, pharmaceutical companies like talking even less. number needed treat. now, this, nnt? number people need take drug undergo surgery medical procedure one person helped. thinking, kind crazy statistic that? number one. doctor prescribe something going help. actually, medical practice work way. doctor's fault, anybody's fault, fault scientists like me. figured underlying mechanisms well enough. glaxosmithkline estimates 90 percent drugs work 30 50 percent people. number needed treat widely prescribed statin, suppose is? many people take one person helped? 300. according research research practitioners jerome groopman pamela hartzband, independently confirmed bloomberg.com. ran numbers myself. 300 people take drug year one heart attack, stroke adverse event prevented. probably thinking, \"well, ok, one 300 chance lowering cholesterol. not, doc? give prescription anyway.\" ask point another statistic, is, \"tell side effects.\" right? particular drug, side effects occur five percent patients. include terrible things -- debilitating muscle joint pain, gastrointestinal distress -- thinking, \"five percent, likely going happen me, i'll still take drug.\" wait minute. remember stress thinking clearly. think going work ahead time, manufacture chain reasoning spot. 300 people take drug, right? one person's helped, five percent 300 side effects, that's 15 people. 15 times likely harmed drug helped drug. now, i'm saying whether take statin not. i'm saying conversation doctor. medical ethics requires it, part principle informed consent. right access kind information begin conversation whether want take risks not. might thinking i've pulled number air shock value, fact rather typical, number needed treat. widely performed surgery men age 50, removal prostate cancer, number needed treat 49. that's right, 49 surgeries done every one person who's helped. side effects case occur 50 percent patients. include impotence, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence. lucky, one 50 percent these, they'll last year two. idea pre-mortem think ahead time questions might able ask push conversation forward. want manufacture spot. also want think things like quality life. choice oftentimes, want shorter life that's pain-free, longer life might great deal pain towards end? things talk think now, family loved ones. might change mind heat moment, least practiced kind thinking. remember, brain stress releases cortisol, one things happens moment whole bunch systems shut down. there's evolutionary reason this. face-to-face predator, need digestive system, libido, immune system, body expending metabolism things react quickly, might become lion's lunch, none things matter. unfortunately, one things goes window times stress rational, logical thinking, danny kahneman colleagues shown. need train think ahead kinds situations. think important point recognizing us flawed. going fail then. idea think ahead failures might be, put systems place help minimize damage, prevent bad things happening first place. getting back snowy night montreal, got back trip, contractor install combination lock next door, key front door it, easy remember combination. admit, still piles mail sorted, piles emails gone through. i'm completely organized, see organization gradual process, i'm getting there. thank much.

(laughter) see you. want pay attention right now. we're going come back minutes, i'm hoping learn tweak little bit, could significantly change way life unfolds. so, we're really fascinated body language, we're particularly interested people's body language. know, we're interested in, like, know — (laughter) — awkward interaction, smile, contemptuous glance, maybe awkward wink, maybe even something like handshake. narrator: arriving number 10. lucky policeman gets shake hands president united states. comes prime minister -- no. (laughter) (applause) (laughter) (applause) amy cuddy: handshake, lack handshake, us talking weeks weeks weeks. even bbc new york times. obviously think nonverbal behavior, body language -- call nonverbals social scientists -- language, think communication. think communication, think interactions. body language communicating me? what's mine communicating you? there's lot reason believe valid way look this. social scientists spent lot time looking effects body language, people's body language, judgments. make sweeping judgments inferences body language. judgments predict really meaningful life outcomes like hire promote, ask date. example, nalini ambady, researcher tufts university, shows people watch 30-second soundless clips real physician-patient interactions, judgments physician's niceness predict whether physician sued. much whether physician incompetent, like person interacted? even dramatic, alex todorov princeton shown us judgments political candidates' faces one second predict 70 percent u.s. senate gubernatorial race outcomes, even, let's go digital, emoticons used well online negotiations lead claim value negotiation. use poorly, bad idea. right? think nonverbals, think judge others, judge us outcomes are. tend forget, though, audience that's influenced nonverbals, that's ourselves. also influenced nonverbals, thoughts feelings physiology. nonverbals talking about? i'm social psychologist. study prejudice, teach competitive business school, inevitable would become interested power dynamics. became especially interested nonverbal expressions power dominance. nonverbal expressions power dominance? well, are. animal kingdom, expanding. make big, stretch out, take space, basically opening up. opening up. true across animal kingdom. limited primates. humans thing. (laughter) power sort chronically, also they're feeling powerful moment. one especially interesting really shows us universal old expressions power are. expression, known pride, jessica tracy studied. shows people born sight people congenitally blind win physical competition. cross finish line they've won, matter they've never seen anyone it. this. arms v, chin slightly lifted. feel powerless? exactly opposite. close up. wrap up. make small. want bump person next us. again, animals humans thing. happens put together high low power. tend comes power complement other's nonverbals. someone really powerful us, tend make smaller. mirror them. opposite them. i'm watching behavior classroom, notice? notice mba students really exhibit full range power nonverbals. people like caricatures alphas, really coming room, get right middle room class even starts, like really want occupy space. sit down, they're sort spread out. raise hands like this. people virtually collapsing come in. soon come in, see it. see faces bodies, sit chair make tiny, go like raise hand. notice couple things this. one, going surprised. seems related gender. women much likely kind thing men. women feel chronically less powerful men, surprising. thing noticed also seemed related extent students participating, well participating. really important mba classroom, participation counts half grade. business schools struggling gender grade gap. get equally qualified women men coming get differences grades, seems partly attributable participation. started wonder, know, okay, people coming like this, they're participating. possible could get people fake would lead participate more? main collaborator dana carney, who's berkeley, really wanted know, fake till make it? like, little actually experience behavioral outcome makes seem powerful? know nonverbals govern people think feel us. there's lot evidence. question really was, nonverbals govern think feel ourselves? there's evidence do. so, example, smile feel happy, also, we're forced smile holding pen teeth like this, makes us feel happy. goes ways. comes power, also goes ways. feel powerful, likely this, also possible pretend powerful, likely actually feel powerful. second question really was, know, know minds change bodies, also true bodies change minds? say minds, case powerful, talking about? i'm talking thoughts feelings sort physiological things make thoughts feelings, case, that's hormones. look hormones. minds powerful versus powerless look like? powerful people tend be, surprisingly, assertive confident, optimistic. actually feel they're going win even games chance. also tend able think abstractly. lot differences. take risks. lot differences powerful powerless people. physiologically, also differences two key hormones: testosterone, dominance hormone, cortisol, stress hormone. find high-power alpha males primate hierarchies high testosterone low cortisol, powerful effective leaders also high testosterone low cortisol. mean? think power, people tended think testosterone, dominance. really, power also react stress. want high-power leader that's dominant, high testosterone, really stress reactive? probably not, right? want person who's powerful assertive dominant, stress reactive, person who's laid back. know primate hierarchies, alpha needs take over, individual needs take alpha role sort suddenly, within days, individual's testosterone gone significantly cortisol dropped significantly. evidence, body shape mind, least facial level, also role changes shape mind. happens, okay, take role change, happens really minimal level, like tiny manipulation, tiny intervention? \"for two minutes,\" say, \"i want stand like this, going make feel powerful.\" did. decided bring people lab run little experiment, people adopted, two minutes, either high-power poses low-power poses, i'm going show five poses, although took two. here's one. couple more. one dubbed \"wonder woman\" media. couple more. standing sitting. low-power poses. folding up, making small. one low-power. touching neck, really protecting yourself. happens. come in, spit vial, two minutes, say, \"you need this.\" look pictures poses. want prime concept power. want feeling power. two minutes this. ask them, \"how powerful feel?\" series items, give opportunity gamble, take another saliva sample. that's it. that's whole experiment. find. risk tolerance, gambling, find high-power pose condition, 86 percent gamble. low-power pose condition, 60 percent, that's whopping significant difference. here's find testosterone. baseline come in, high-power people experience 20-percent increase, low-power people experience 10-percent decrease. again, two minutes, get changes. here's get cortisol. high-power people experience 25-percent decrease, low-power people experience 15-percent increase. two minutes lead hormonal changes configure brain basically either assertive, confident comfortable, really stress-reactive, feeling sort shut down. we've feeling, right?

   human voice: instrument play. powerful sound world, probably. one start war say \"i love you.\" yet many people experience speak, people listen them. that? speak powerfully make change world? i'd like suggest, number habits need move away from. i've assembled pleasure seven deadly sins speaking. i'm pretending exhaustive list, seven, think, pretty large habits fall into. first, gossip. speaking ill somebody who's present. nice habit, know perfectly well person gossiping, five minutes later, gossiping us. second, judging. know people like conversation, hard listen somebody know judged found wanting time. third, negativity. fall this. mother, last years life, became negative, hard listen. remember one day, said her, \"it's october 1 today,\" said, \"i know, dreadful?\" (laughter) hard listen somebody's negative. (laughter) another form negativity, complaining. well, national art u.k. national sport. complain weather, sport, politics, everything, actually, complaining viral misery. spreading sunshine lightness world. excuses. we've met guy. maybe we've guy. people blamethrower. pass everybody else take responsibility actions, again, hard listen somebody like that. penultimate, sixth seven, embroidery, exaggeration. demeans language, actually, sometimes. example, see something really awesome, call it? (laughter) then, course, exaggeration becomes lying, want listen people know lying us. finally, dogmatism. confusion facts opinions. two things get conflated, listening wind. know, somebody bombarding opinions true. difficult listen that. are, seven deadly sins speaking. things think need avoid. positive way think this? yes, is. i'd like suggest four really powerful cornerstones, foundations, stand want speech powerful make change world. fortunately, things spell word. word \"hail,\" great definition well. i'm talking stuff falls sky hits head. i'm talking definition, greet acclaim enthusiastically, think words received stand four things. stand for? see guess. h, honesty, course, true say, straight clear. authenticity, yourself. friend mine described standing truth, think lovely way put it. integrity, word, actually say, somebody people trust. l love. mean romantic love, mean wishing people well, two reasons. first all, think absolute honesty may want. mean, goodness, look ugly morning. perhaps that's necessary. tempered love, course, honesty great thing. also, really wishing somebody well, hard judge time. i'm even sure two things simultaneously. hail. also, that's say, like old song, say, also way say it. amazing toolbox. instrument incredible, yet toolbox people ever opened. i'd like little rummage pull tools might like take away play with, increase power speaking. register, example. now, falsetto register may useful time, there's register between. i'm going get technical voice coaches. locate voice, however. talk nose, hear difference. go throat, us speak time. want weight, need go chest. hear difference? vote politicians lower voices, true, associate depth power authority. that's register. timbre. way voice feels. again, research shows prefer voices rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. well that's you, that's end world, train. go get voice coach. amazing things breathing, posture, exercises improve timbre voice. prosody. love prosody. sing-song, meta-language use order impart meaning. root one meaning conversation. people speak one note really quite hard listen prosody all. that's word \"monotonic\" comes from, monotonous, monotone. also, repetitive prosody coming in, every sentence ends question actually question, statement? (laughter) repeat one, actually restricting ability communicate prosody, think shame, let's try break habit. pace. get excited saying something really quickly, slow right emphasize, end that, course, old friend silence. there's nothing wrong bit silence talk, there? fill ums ahs. powerful. course, pitch often goes along pace indicate arousal, pitch. leave keys? (higher pitch) leave keys? so, slightly different meaning two deliveries. finally, volume. (loud) get really excited using volume. sorry that, startled anybody. or, really pay attention getting quiet. people broadcast whole time. try that. that's called sodcasting, (laughter) imposing sound people around carelessly inconsiderately. nice. course, comes play got something really important do. might standing stage like giving talk people. might proposing marriage, asking raise, wedding speech. whatever is, really important, owe look toolbox engine going work on, engine works well without warmed up. warm voice. actually, let show that. would like stand moment? i'm going show six vocal warm-up exercises every talk ever do. time going talk anybody important, these. first, arms up, deep breath in, sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. one time. ahhhh, good. we're going warm lips, we're going go ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba. good. now, brrrrrrrrrr, like kid. brrrr. lips coming alive. we're going tongue next exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. beautiful. getting really good this. then, roll r. rrrrrrr. that's like champagne tongue. finally, one, pros call siren. really good. starts \"we\" goes \"aw.\" \"we\" high, \"aw\" low. go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. fantastic. give round applause. take seat, thank you. (applause) next time speak, advance. let put context close. serious point here. now, right? speak well people simply listening environment that's noise bad acoustics. talked stage different phases. would world like speaking powerfully people listening consciously environments actually fit purpose? make bit larger, would world like creating sound consciously consuming sound consciously designing environments consciously sound? would world sound beautiful, one understanding would norm, idea worth spreading. thank you.

(laughter) now, there's really good reason allow pundits show: they're really boring. they're conservative, they're going hate obama food stamps abortion. they're liberal, they're going hate big banks oil corporations dick cheney. totally predictable. want like that. need enter every conversation assuming something learn. famed therapist m. scott peck said true listening requires setting aside oneself. sometimes means setting aside personal opinion. said sensing acceptance, speaker become less less vulnerable likely open inner recesses mind listener. again, assume something learn. bill nye: \"everyone ever meet knows something don't.\" put way: everybody expert something. number three: use open-ended questions. case, take cue journalists. start questions who, what, when, where, how. put complicated question, going get simple answer out. ask you, \"were terrified?\" going respond powerful word sentence, \"terrified,\" answer \"yes, was\" \"no, wasn't.\" \"were angry?\" \"yes, angry.\" let describe it. they're ones know. try asking things like, \"what like?\" \"how feel?\" might stop moment think it, going get much interesting response. number four: go flow. means thoughts come mind need let go mind. we've heard interviews often guest talking several minutes host comes back asks question seems like comes nowhere, already answered. means host probably stopped listening two minutes ago thought really clever question, bound determined say that. exact thing. we're sitting conversation someone, remember time met hugh jackman coffee shop. (laughter) stop listening. stories ideas going come you. need let come let go. number five: know, say know. now, people radio, especially npr, much aware they're going record, they're careful claim expert claim know sure. that. err side caution. talk cheap. number six: equate experience theirs. they're talking lost family member, start talking time lost family member. they're talking trouble they're work, tell much hate job. same. never same. experiences individual. and, importantly, you. need take moment prove amazing much suffered. somebody asked stephen hawking iq was, said, \"i idea. people brag iqs losers.\" (laughter) conversations promotional opportunity. number seven: try repeat yourself. condescending, really boring, tend lot. especially work conversations conversations kids, point make, keep rephrasing over. that. number eight: stay weeds. frankly, people care years, names, dates, details struggling come mind. care. care you. care like, common. forget details. leave out. number nine: last one, important one. listen. cannot tell many really important people said listening perhaps most, number one important skill could develop. buddha said, i'm paraphrasing, \"if mouth open, learning.\" calvin coolidge said, \"no man ever listened way job.\" (laughter) listen other? number one, we'd rather talk. i'm talking, i'm control. hear anything i'm interested in. i'm center attention. bolster identity. there's another reason: get distracted. average person talks 225 word per minute, listen 500 words per minute. minds filling 275 words. look, know, takes effort energy actually pay attention someone, can't that, conversation. two people shouting barely related sentences place. (laughter) listen one another. stephen covey said beautifully. said, \"most us listen intent understand. listen intent reply.\" one rule, number 10, it’s one: brief. interested people. know, grew famous grandfather, kind ritual home. people would come talk grandparents, would leave, mother would come us, she’d say, “do know was? runner-up miss america. mayor sacramento. pulitzer prize. he's russian ballet dancer.\" kind grew assuming everyone hidden, amazing thing them. honestly, think makes better host. keep mouth shut often possibly can. keep mind open. i’m always prepared amazed, i'm never disappointed. thing. go out, talk people, listen people, and, importantly, prepared amazed. thanks.

no, full misery. fact, frostbite difficulty walking, difficulty breathing -- cold, challenging circumstances. people trying happy, moment would get top, would say, \"this terrible mistake. i'll never again.\" (laughter) \"instead, let sit beach somewhere drinking mojitos.\" instead, people go down, recover, go again. think mountain climbing example, suggests kinds things. suggests care reaching end, peak. suggests care fight, challenge. suggests there's kinds things motivate us work behave kinds ways. personally, started thinking student came visit me. one students years earlier, came one day back campus. told following story: said two weeks, working powerpoint presentation. working big bank, preparation merger acquisition. working hard presentation -- graphs, tables, information. stayed late night every day. day due, sent powerpoint presentation boss, boss wrote back said, \"nice presentation, merger canceled.\" guy deeply depressed. moment working, actually quite happy. every night enjoying work, staying late, perfecting powerpoint presentation. knowing nobody would ever watch made quite depressed. started thinking experiment idea fruits labor. start with, created little experiment gave people legos, asked build legos. people, gave legos said, \"hey, would like build bionicle three dollars? we'll pay three dollars it.\" people said yes, built legos. finished, took it, put table, said, \"would like build another one, time $2.70?\" said yes, gave another one, finished, asked them, \"do want build another one?\" $2.40, $2.10, on, point people said, \"no more. worth me.\" called meaningful condition. people built one bionicle another. finished every one them, put table. told end experiment, take bionicles, disassemble them, put back boxes, use next participant. another condition. condition inspired david, student. condition called sisyphic condition. remember story sisyphus, sisyphus punished gods push rock hill, almost got end, rock would roll over, would start again. think essence futile work. imagine pushed rock different hills, least would sense progress. also, look prison movies, sometimes way guards torture prisoners get dig hole, prisoner finished, ask fill hole back dig again. there's something cyclical version something seems particularly demotivating. second condition experiment, that's exactly did. asked people, \"would like build one bionicle three dollars?\" said yes, built it. asked them, \"do want build another one $2.70?\" said yes, gave new one, building it, took apart one finished. finished that, said, \"would like build another one, time 30 cents less?\" said yes, gave one built broke. endless cycle building, us destroying front eyes. happens compare two conditions? first thing happened people built many bionicles -- eleven meaningful condition, versus seven sisyphus condition. way, point big meaning. people curing cancer building bridges. people building bionicles cents. that, everybody knew bionicles would destroyed quite soon. real opportunity big meaning. even small meaning made difference. another version experiment. version experiment, put people situation, described situation, much describing now, asked predict result would be. happened? people predicted right direction right magnitude. people given description experiment said meaningful condition, people would probably build one bionicle. people understand meaning important, understand magnitude importance, extent important. one piece data looked at. think it, people love legos, people don't. would speculate people love legos would build legos, even less money, all, get internal joy it. people love legos less would build less legos enjoyment derive lower. that's actually found meaningful condition. nice correlation love legos amount legos people built. happened sisyphic condition? condition, correlation zero -- relationship love legos, much people built, suggests manipulation breaking things front people's eyes, basically crushed joy could get activity. basically eliminated it. soon finished running experiment, went talk big software company seattle. can't tell were, big company seattle. group within software company put different building, asked innovate, create next big product company. week showed up, ceo big software company went group, 200 engineers, canceled project. stood front 200 depressed people i've ever talked to. described lego experiments, said felt like experiment. asked them, said, \"how many show work later used to?\" everybody raised hand. said, \"how many go home earlier used to?\" everybody raised hand. asked them, \"how many add not-so-kosher things expense reports?\" raise hands, took dinner showed could expense reports. asked them, said, \"what could ceo done make depressed?\" came kinds ideas. said ceo could asked present whole company journey last two years decided do. could asked think aspect technology could fit parts organization. could asked build next-generation prototypes, see would work. thing one would require effort motivation. think ceo basically understand importance meaning. ceo, like participants, thought essence meaning unimportant, [wouldn't] care. would say, \"at moment directed way, i'm directing way, everything okay.\" understood important meaning is, would figure actually important spend time, energy effort getting people care they're doing. next experiment slightly different. took sheet paper random letters, asked people find pairs letters identical next other. task. people first sheet, asked wanted another little less money, next sheet little bit less, forth. three conditions. first condition, people wrote name sheet, found pairs letters, gave experimenter, experimenter would look it, scan top bottom, say \"uh huh,\" put pile next them. second condition, people write name it. experimenter looked it, took sheet paper, look it, scan it, simply put pile pages. take piece, put side. third condition, experimenter got sheet paper, put directly shredder. (laughter) happened three conditions? plot i'm showing pay rate people stopped. low numbers mean people worked harder. worked much longer. acknowledged condition, people worked way 15 cents. 15 cents per page, basically stopped efforts. shredder condition, twice much -- 30 cents per sheet. basically result before. shred people's efforts, output -- get happy they're doing. point out, way, shredder condition, people could cheated. could done good work, realized people shredding it. maybe first sheet good work, see nobody really testing it, would more. fact, shredder condition, people could submitted work gotten money, put less effort it. ignored condition? would ignored condition like acknowledged like shredder, somewhere middle? turns almost like shredder. there's good news bad news here. bad news ignoring performance people almost bad shredding effort front eyes. ignoring gets whole way there. good news simply looking something somebody done, scanning saying \"uh huh,\" seems quite sufficient dramatically improve people's motivations. good news adding motivation seem difficult. bad news eliminating motivations seems incredibly easy, think carefully, might overdo it. terms negative motivation, eliminating negative motivation. next part want show something positive motivation. store u.s. called ikea. ikea store kind okay furniture takes long time assemble. (laughter) know you, every time assemble one those, takes much longer, much effortful, much confusing, put things wrong way -- can't say enjoy pieces. can't say enjoy process. finish it, seem like ikea pieces furniture like ones. (laughter) there's old story cake mixes. started cake mixes '40s, would take powder would put box, would ask housewives basically pour in, stir water it, mix it, put oven, -- voila -- cake. turns unpopular. people want them, thought kinds reasons that. maybe taste good? no, taste great. figured enough effort involved. easy nobody could serve cake guests say, \"here cake.\" no, somebody else's cake, bought store. really feel like own. do? took eggs milk powder. (laughter) break eggs add them, measure milk add it, mixing it. cake. everything fine. (laughter) (applause) now, think little bit like ikea effect, getting people work harder, actually got love they're higher degree. look question experimentally? asked people build origami. gave instructions create origami, gave sheet paper. novices, built something really quite ugly -- nothing like frog crane. told them, \"look, origami really belongs us. worked us, i'll tell what, we'll sell you. much want pay it?\" measured much willing pay it. two types people: people built it, people build it, looked external observers. found builders thought beautiful pieces origami -- (laughter) willing pay five times people evaluated externally. could say -- builder, think [you'd say], \"oh, love origami, know nobody else would love it?\" \"i love origami, everybody else love well?\" one two correct? turns builders loved origami more, thought everybody would see world view. thought everybody else would love well. next version, tried ikea effect. tried make difficult. people, gave task. people, made harder hiding instructions. top sheet, little diagrams fold origami. people, eliminated that. tougher. happened? well objective way, origami uglier, difficult. looked easy origami, saw thing -- builders loved more, evaluators loved less. looked hard instructions, effect larger. why? builders loved even more. (laughter) put extra effort it. evaluators? loved even less. reality, even uglier first version. (laughter) course, tells something evaluate things. think kids. imagine asked you, \"how much would sell kids for?\" memories associations on. people would say lot, lot money. (laughter) good days. (laughter) imagine slightly different. imagine kids. one day went park met kids. like kids, played hours, leave, parents said, \"hey, way, leave, interested, they're sale.\" (laughter) much would pay now? people say much. kids valuable, are, us, connected us, time connection. way, think ikea instructions good, instructions come kids, really tough. (laughter) way, kids, which, course, wonderful on. comes tell one thing, is, much like builders, look creature creation, see people see things way. let say one last comment. think adam smith versus karl marx, adam smith important notion efficiency. gave example pin factory. said pins 12 different steps, one person 12 steps, production low. get one person step one, one person step two step three on, production increase tremendously. indeed, great example, reason industrial revolution efficiency. karl marx, hand, said alienation labor incredibly important people think connection doing. 12 steps, care pin. one step every time, maybe care much. think industrial revolution, adam smith correct karl marx. reality we've switched, we're knowledge economy. ask yourself, happens knowledge economy? efficiency still important meaning? think answer no. think move situations people decide much effort, attention, caring, connected feel it, thinking labor way work, shower on, sudden marx things say us. think labor, usually think motivation payment thing, reality probably add kinds things -- meaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etc. good news added components thought -- create meaning, pride, motivation, workplace, employees -- think could get people productive happier. thank much.

fitness changed life, wanted others small-town michigan experience. problem gyms intimidating. ultimate irony. go gym get shape, shape, feel like need get shape show up. that's many 50 percent gym members quit within first year, fine open gym new york la millions people. small town, might simply run customers. many gyms try solve problem making difficult quit. feeling guilty going gym, i’m stuck paying 100 dollars month, i’m still getting thinner. chris decided something different. chris decided invest workers. hired overly helpful, overly friendly employees moment eager step help learn use piece equipment without making feel like judged. idea 55-year-old mom dad, who’d never gym lives, feel welcome comfortable immediately. question private equity investor is: could really profitable? there's old joke man who's much drink looking keys streetlight. cop comes offers help asks thinks lost them. \"in park,\" comes response, \"but i'm looking light's better.\" that's little investors look companies today. know value companies driven people, focus short-term profit much easier measure. i’ve worked around private equity 25 years six continents, i've seen error thinking again. private equity, buy companies seek improve sell profit. often improvement comes form cutting costs, especially labor costs. private equity employs roughly nine million people cut million jobs past decade. often ask company org chart figure getting fired. think investors take pride helping make companies lean, i'm worried may done job well risk starving companies people need successful. big opportunity investors, executives create rather cut good jobs. creating good jobs focus work social impact investor. create good jobs, first need definition good job, surprisingly hard find. spreadsheets numbers comforting, people complicated, impact investing sometimes feel squishy. good soul, perhaps, risky pocketbook. partners work company prides using data solve problems. spent last two years looking academic research, reading case studies. interviewed human capital experts surveyed workers across hundreds companies. work, developed common sense definition good job, one correlates worker productivity helps us build better companies. is. good job worker, one, fairly treated. two, promising future. three, feels psychologically safe. four, sense purpose. definition, third jobs today qualify good jobs. that's data-driven impact investing help. putting hard numbers conditions, score job companies invest work improve number good jobs companies. let's go four conditions turn, do, think place work. measure up? answer \"not good,\" worry, help point company right direction. go. number one, worker fairly treated. spend roughly third adult lives working. whether work marshall's microsoft, want employer pay fairly time. many investors see worker pay zero-sum game. whatever company gives workers must somehow come expense, home depot announced early covid would offering danger pay making investments worker safety, saw market value crash billions dollars. research found 100 studies show appropriate incentives, attractive benefits like retirement accounts health care things like flexible schedules pay improved productivity, higher retention, lower hiring costs. home depot company that's built idea providing better service customers employing experts shop floors. people seen problem they've worked home repair construction, help fix better. home depot thriving today thanks investment workers. fair pay critical, critical thing, thing matters. brings us second condition: promising future. fast food restaurants pay low wages, also offer little terms learning growth, employees quit six 12 months average. think next time get rude service drive-thru window. training career path help solve riddle. restaurants like tender greens california boloko boston offer training low-wage workers qualifies management roles. might start dishwasher earning 12 bucks hour right training, become restaurant manager matter months, making nearly three times much. prospect tripling wage powerful motivator. data shows workers much loyal dedicated feel company helping build career. third condition, psychological safety, fairly obvious one. think best boss ever had, one motivated go beyond work. bet person listener. modern workplace increasingly place communication collaboration. many workers find difficult risky speak up. professor amy edmondson harvard studied issue government, nonprofits companies found people's first instinct self-protect. let's face it, life's short correct boss's mistake think might get fired result. speaking invisible, cost company valuable ideas. squander employee talent worse, put customers employees physical risk. google found quest create perfect team important ingredient people involved rather team's overall willingness share listen. also found great teams hide mistakes, rather embrace opportunities learning add overall iq companies. brings us purpose. lot easier share listen others colleagues feel passionately work. feel passionately idea going work day sole purpose maximizing shareholder value investors never met? energizing idea. humans, unlike machines, want feel connected higher purpose. want feel proud useful. fortunately, companies exist reason. hard tell many mission statements read like generated robot. actually used online mission statement generator talk see would come back. \"the mission ted talk offer smart insights empathy, care thoughtfulness.\" bad computer. good mission statement nice words powerpoint. good mission statement distilled form strategy, guiding light company employees. fitness chain mentioned earlier, impact fitness, clear mission offer health fitness underserved communities, they're deadly serious it. founder, chris, likes repeat mission company meetings. gym owners would thrilled customers never showed up, long keep paying monthly bill. chris wants people show workout gyms get healthier. that's tracked gym usage, tied executive pay. company gone strength strength, growing single gym northville, michigan, three dozen gyms across small-town michigan, indiana canada. done way employees every reason proud of. old corporate chestnut employees valuable asset. today words ring hollow automated voice, telling us important call we've hold 10 minutes. (laughter) fortunately, creating good jobs rocket science. four conditions: fair treatment, promising future, psychological safety purpose relatively easy track improve. that, though, requires investors executives work together. often well-meaning ceos cut short short-term oriented investors boards represent them. believe better measure good jobs associated benefits, investors support investments workers. wouldn’t want create good jobs creating valuable companies time? research shows companies higher proportion good jobs grow faster profitable. attract better talent innovative. investors ignore issue peril today's economy, good jobs good society, they're good business. thank you.\n"
